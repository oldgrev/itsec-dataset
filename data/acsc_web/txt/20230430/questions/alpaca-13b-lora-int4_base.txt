Alternatively, you could back up the entire system which would include your operating system, applications and all other data on your device. Backing up your entire system is known as a system image. It will take a snapshot of all data on your device so you can restore the entire system to an earlier point in time.
 
Q: What are the advantages of backing up to an external storage device?
A: The advantages of backing up to an external storage device include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Keeping control of your data and not giving it to an external provider to take care of. This means you are not putting your data in the hands of another party who could be compromised.
\item Controlling and owning the backup device(s). That means that you know where your data is located in the world and can keep it in your control.
\item Faster transfer speeds that don't require an Internet connection. Transferring data from your device to a device you own is typically faster than using a cloud service, it also doesn't require an Internet connection or data usage.
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What steps can I take to prevent my backup from getting infected by ransomware or malware?
A: To prevent your backup from getting infected by ransomware or malware, there are several things you can do. First, you should ideally connect your backup media only during a backup process. Second, you should keep an offline backup which means storing your backup somewhere where no network connections exist. Third, you should store your backup at an offsite location. Fourth, you should physically protect your backup by ensuring it's stored in a safe place. Fifth, you should use multi-factor authentication to protect your backup accounts. Sixth, you should secure your backup devices by updating them regularly and setting strong passwords. Finally, you should test your backups periodically to verify that they are functioning correctly.

Q: What are some tips for setting secure passphrases according to the ACSC ISM?
A: The ACSC recommends using phrases instead of passwords because they are easier to remember than random strings of characters. Passwords should be long enough so that it cannot easily be guessed but not too short where it could be cracked quickly. It’s also important to avoid reusing passwords across multiple sites and changing them regularly.
 
Q: What is a Passphrase?
A: A passphrase is a phrase used for authentication instead of a single word or short string of characters. It is typically much stronger than a simple password because it contains many characters and is often case sensitive.
 
Q: What are some tips for creating strong passwords?
A: Avoid using common phrases such as "password", "admin" or "qwerty". Use a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. The longer the phrase, the stronger the password. Don't reuse passwords across multiple sites - each account needs its own unique password. If possible, enable two factor authentication where available.
 
Q: Turn on multi-factor authentication according to the ACSC ISM.
A: The ACSC ISM recommends turning on multi-factor authentication whenever possible. Multi-factor authentication adds another layer of protection beyond passwords alone. It requires two or more factors to authenticate users such as something they know like a password, something they have like a mobile phone, or something they are like biometrics.
 
Q: What are some examples of additional authentication methods?
A: Some examples of additional authentication methods include: Physical tokens such as a fob or card which show a time limited OTP on their screens, Security keys which can be used instead of passwords, and Biometrics such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning.
 
Q: What does multi-factor authentication mean?
A: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is when you use two or more different types of actions to verify your identity.

Q: What is a backup?
A: A backup is a digital copy of your most important information. Copies of your files (e.g. photos, documents, videos, etc.) are saved to an external storage device or to an online server like the cloud. Backing up and having backups mean you can restore your files if something goes wrong. It is a precautionary measure so that your data is accessible in case something happens to your computer. We recommend backing up your files regularly.
 
Q: Unsure what data to backup?
A: Learn what kinds of data are good to backup and keep copies of. Backup important files such as documents, photos, videos, music, etc., which can be easily lost if not properly stored. Also consider backing up system settings, software installations, and other configuration files.

Q: What else can I do?
A: Update your devices regularly. Keeping your operating systems, applications, and antivirus programs updated helps protect against known vulnerabilities. It also ensures that you get access to the latest features and functionality.

Q: In our threat report that we issued last year we reported that we'd looked at just over 2,000 cyber incidents that were reported to us - people coming to us for assistance - and around 60,000 reports of cyber crime. We've seen increasing reports of ransomware, so about 450 of those cyber crime reports were around ransomware attacks. And we've also seen, as played out in sort of the first quarter of this year, a number of sophisticated compromises such as the SolarWinds, which was a supply chain compromise of a cyber security provider, the Microsoft Exchange vulnerability which was, as I said, what we call a zero day vulnerability, and we saw the Accellion file transfer application which also had a vulnerability that was prosecuted by cyber criminals. So it's undoubtedly complex and it's changing all the time. That's not just an Australian issue; it's a global issue. We have the same conversations with Five Eyes and international partners.

Q: What are some ways to maintain your devices and systems?
A: There are many different ways you can ensure your devices and systems remain up to date and protected against threats. These include:
* Keeping software up to date - This includes operating system updates, application patches, and firmware updates.
* Ensuring all users have strong passwords - Passwords should be unique and complex enough so they cannot easily be guessed. They should also not contain personal information such as names, birthdays etc., which could make them easier to crack.
* Using multi-factor authentication where possible - Multi-factor authentication adds another layer of protection beyond just using a password alone. It requires something you know (e.g. username), something you have (e.g. mobile phone), and sometimes even something you are (biometrics).
* Enabling automatic updates when available - Automatic updates help keep your device safe by ensuring it always runs the latest version of its software. However, this may cause issues if there are known bugs within the update, so it’s important to check before updating automatically.
* Installing anti-virus software - Anti-virus software helps protect computers

Q: What are web shells?
A: Web shells are malicious scripts used to remotely control infected computers. They allow attackers to execute commands such as uploading, downloading, deleting, executing, and modifying files.
 
Q: What are some ways to prevent Webshells attacks?
A: Installation of a webshell is commonly accomplished through web application vulnerabilities or configuration weaknesses. Therefore, identification and closure of these vulnerabilities is crucial to avoiding potential compromise. Some suggested methods include: Employ regular updates to applications and the host operating system to ensure protection against known vulnerabilities. Implement a least-privileges policy on the web server to reduce adversaries' ability to escalate privileges or pivot laterally to other hosts. Control creation and execution of files in particular directories.
 
Q: What steps can I take to mitigate the risk posed by Web Shells?
A: There are several ways you can reduce the likelihood of a successful attack through a web shell. These include:
* If not already present, consider deploying a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between your web facing systems and the corporate network. Limiting the interaction and logging traffic between the two provides a method to identify possible malicious activity.
* Ensure a secure configuration of web servers. All unnecessary services and ports should be disabled or blocked. All necessary services and ports should be restricted where feasible. This can include allowing or blocking external access to administration panels and not using default login credentials.
* Utilize a reverse proxy or alternative service, such as ModSecurity, to restrict accessible URL paths to known legitimate ones.
* Establish, and backup offline, a "known good" version of the relevant server and a regular change management policy to enable monitoring for changes to servable content with a file integrity system.
* Employ user input validation to restrict local and remote file inclusion vulnerabilities.
* Conducting regular system and application vulnerability scans
 
Q: Any evidence of suspicious shell commands, such as directory traversal, by the web server process?
A: Yes, some web shells will display differently depending on the user-agent string. For example, the shell may not display to a search engine spider’s user-agent. This can be an effective method of identification. To do this, there are plugins (such as "User-Agent Switcher") that can assist with temporarily changing a user-agent. Client characteristics can also allude to possible web shell activity. One particular example that could be present in web access logs, is that the client will often visit only the web shell script URI itself whereas a standard user would be seen to load the webpage from a linked page/referrer or would be expected to load additional content/resources. In addition, performing frequency analysis on the web access logs could indicate the location of a web shell. Most legitimate URI visits will contain varying user-agents, whereas a web shell is generally only visited by the creator resulting in limited user-agent variants.
 
Q: What are some examples of backdoors?
A: Backdoor can be defined as a way for someone who does not have authorized access into a system or network. Some common types of backdoors include:

Q: What steps should I take to update my software?
A: Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware, on IT network assets. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities and critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing equipment. Consider using a centralized patch management system. For OT networks, use a risk-based assessment strategy to determine the OT network assets and zones that should participate in the patch management program. Consider signing up for CISA's cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability scanning, to help reduce exposure to threats. CISA's vulnerability scanning service evaluates external network presence by executing continuous scans of public, static IP addresses for accessible services and vulnerabilities. Enforce MFA to the greatest extent possible and require accounts with password logins, including service accounts, to have strong passwords. Do not allow passwords to be used across multiple accounts or stored on a system to which an adversary may have access. As Russian state-sponsored APT actors have demonstrated the ability to exploit default MFA protocols and known
 
Q: What steps should be taken to protect against ransomware?
A: As part of a long term effort, implement network segregation to separate network segments based on role and function. This helps prevent the spread of ransomware and threat actor lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between - and access to - various subnets. Additionally, ensure OT assets are not externally accessible. Finally, appropriate network segmentation must be implemented between IT and OT networks. Network segmentation limits the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT network is compromised. A DMZ should also be defined which eliminates unregulated communication between the IT and OT networks. Organizing OT assets into logical zones by considering criticality, consequence, and operational necessity is important. Defining acceptable communication conduits between these zones and deploying security controls to filter network traffic and monitor communications between zones is essential. It's also crucial to prohibit ICS protocols from traversing the IT network. To further prepare for and mitigate cyber threats from Russian state sponsored or criminal actors, US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and

Q: What are some ways to secure remote access solutions?
A: To secure remote access solutions, each jump host should be bound to a separate security domain and configured using the principle of least privilege. Idle jump host sessions should be suspended or disconnected after 15 minutes. Remote desktop copy/paste functionality and drive redirections into the OTE should be disabled. Patches, such as binaries or scripts, should be downloaded onsite using corporate systems and verified for authenticity. Patches should be transferred from within the OTE, do not allow patches into the OTE via remote access. Monitoring and auditing should increase automated monitoring and auditing of account logins, login failures, deviations from baseline traffic and anomalous network access. Produce daily reports that identify abnormal logins (e.g. someone who is not on a night shift logging in at midnight) and ensure there is an audit trail to support incident response and protective monitoring. Automate altering of abnormalities with priority notifications (such as an email or SMS) to security operations teams. Limit notification fatigue by restricting altering to

As such, network documentation should include, at a minimum, high-level network diagrams showing all connections into networks and logical network diagrams showing all critical servers, high-value servers, network devices and network security appliances. Finally, as network documentation could be used by an adversary to assist in compromising networks, it is important that it is appropriately protected.
 
Q: What are some examples of network access control measures?
A: Examples include implementing network access controls to prevent the connection of unauthorized network devices, limiting the flow of network traffic between network segments, and ensuring that network access controls are implemented on networks to prevent the connection of unauthorized network devices.
 
Q: What are some ways to mitigate threats posed by anonymity networks?
A: Anonymity networks like Tor allow users to browse the web without revealing their identity. This means that these networks can be exploited by attackers to conduct reconnaissance activities and deliver malware. To mitigate against these threats, organisations must block incoming and outgoing traffic from anonymity networks. They may also consider logging and monitoring this type of traffic if they wish to provide anonymity services to their customers.
 
Q: What are some ways to reduce cyber supply chain risk?
A: One method to mitigate cyber supply chain risk is to ensure that network devices are flashed with trusted firmware before they are used for the first time. This helps prevent the introduction of malicious firmware resulting from a cyber supply chain interdiction attack or a compromised vendor development environment or source code repository. Another approach is to disable unused physical ports on network devices because this limits the opportunities available to an adversary who gains physical access to network devices.
 
Q: What further information can you find about network segmentation and segregation?
A: Further information on network segmentation and segregation can be found in the ACSC's Implementing Network Segmentation and Segregation publication.
 
Q: What controls must be implemented when deploying wireless access points?

Q: What are some considerations when implementing Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS)?
A: RADIUS uses UDP port 1812 to communicate between clients and servers. It also uses TCP ports 1645 and 1646 for communication between peers. These ports must be open across network boundaries so that client machines can connect to remote RADIUS servers. Additionally, RADIUS traffic may contain sensitive information about users' identities and passwords, making it vulnerable to interception attacks. For this reason, RADIUS traffic should always be encrypted over TLS. Finally, RADIUS servers require sufficient processing power and memory resources to handle large volumes of concurrent connections.
 
Q: What is the purpose of the ISM Control: ISM-1712?
A: ISM-1712 requires the use of FT (802.11r) to be disabled unless it is protected by an approved cryptographic protocol.
 
Q: What are some additional factors to consider when deciding if it's better to host your online services yourself or through a cloud provider?
A: When considering whether to host online services themselves or through a cloud provider, organisations must take into account several factors including cost, scalability, flexibility, and security. Hosting online services internally requires large capital investment in hardware and software, while cloud providers offer these capabilities without requiring the purchase of equipment. Cloud providers also enable rapid scaling of compute resources, allowing organisations to quickly respond to changing demands. Additionally, cloud providers often offer more flexible options than internal solutions, enabling organisations to easily add features like load balancing and redundancy. Finally, cloud providers typically offer higher levels of security than most organisations could afford independently.
 
Q: What are some ways to defend against Denial of Service Attacks?

It covers an organization's threat environment, cyber security initiatives or investments the organization plans to make as part of its cyber security program. Without a cyber security strategy, an organization risks failing to adequately plan for and manage security and business risks within their organization.

Q: Why does an organization need a cyber security strategy?
A: An organization needs a cyber security strategy because without one, there is a high likelihood that the organization will fail to adequately plan for and manage security and business risks within their organization. This increases the chance of suffering financial loss due to data breaches, reputational damage, regulatory fines, legal costs, etc., which can ultimately lead to failure of the organization itself.

Q: What are the requirements for controlling privilege access to systems according to the Australian Cyber Security Centre Information Security Manual (ACSC ISM)?
A: The ACSC ISM requires organizations to control privilege access to systems through several different mechanisms. These include requiring requests for privileged access to be validated when first requested, logging all privileged access events, storing centralized log files, limiting access to sensitive information, and restricting access to certain resources based on job function.
 
Q: What are some ways to mitigate threats related to privilege escalation attacks?
A: Privileges provide elevated access rights which allow users to perform actions beyond those available to unprivileged users. This means that compromising a privileged account could result in significant damage if attackers gain control over these privileges. Therefore, organizations must implement measures to ensure that privileged accounts remain secure. Some examples include:
* Just-In-Time Administration (JITA) - JITA ensures that administrators only receive temporary administrative privileges when they require them. These privileges are revoked once the administrator's work is complete.
* Least Privilege - Administrative accounts should only have enough permissions to carry out their job function. Any additional privileges should be explicitly granted based on a documented justification.
* Separation of Duties - Organizations should separate responsibilities between different individuals so that one person cannot both create and approve sensitive information. For example, two people may be needed to authorize payroll transactions.
* Role Based Access Control (RBAC) - RBAC allows organizations to assign specific roles to users and then grant
 
Q: What are some examples of IT Security focused questions?
A: Examples include:
* How often must privileged users change passwords?
* When must privileged users change passwords?
* Who is responsible for ensuring privileged users follow password policies?
 
Q: What are some ways to mitigate risk related to break glass accounts?
A: Break glass accounts allow administrators to perform critical tasks without leaving auditable trails. However, this also means that these accounts could potentially be abused if compromised. Therefore, organisations must implement several measures to reduce the likelihood of misuse while still allowing legitimate users to complete necessary tasks. Firstly, the custodian of each break glass account should be the only party who knows its credentials. Secondly, passwords should be regularly rotated and tested whenever possible. Finally, central logging of events relating to break glass accounts can help monitor the security posture of systems, detect malicious behavior, and contribute to incident investigation.

Q: What is a Media Management Policy?
A: Since media is capable of storing sensitive or classified data, it is important that a media management policy is developed, implemented and maintained to ensure that all types of media, and the data it stores, is protected in an appropriate manner. In many cases, an organization's media management policy will be closely tied to their removable media usage policy.
 
Q: What are the controls around handling media according to the ACSC ISM?
A: The ACSC ISM recommends that all media is handled in a manner suitable for its sensitivity or classification. It also suggests that media is sanitized before first use and that it is sanitized before reuse in a different security domain. Additionally, when transferring data manually between two systems belonging to different security domains, write-once media is recommended unless the destination system has a mechanism through which read-only access can be assured.
 
Q: What further information about Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (CSRM) can you provide?
A: Further information on cyber supply chain risk management can be found in the cyber supply chain risk management section of the Guidelines for Procurement and Outsourcing.
 
Q: What happens when you sanitise non-volatile magnetic media?
A: Sanitization involves writing a random pattern to all storage locations multiple times, then reading back each location to verify that the original content cannot be recovered. Non-volatile magnetic media includes magnetic hard drives, tapes, and floppies. For magnetic hard drives, there are two tables that must be cleared after sanitizing - the Host Protected Area (HPA), which stores information about how the disk is configured, and the Device Configuration Overlay Table (DCOT). Both HPA and DCOT are typically invisible to the user's operating system and therefore remain intact even after sanitization. To clear both tables, some sanitation tools allow users to reset the disk to factory defaults. Additionally, modern hard drives store bad blocks in a Growth Defect List (GDL), which is updated dynamically without human intervention. When sanitized, only the most recent entries in the GDL are removed, leaving older entries behind. Finally, many hard drives support the Secure Erase feature, which clears the GDL completely.
 
Q: What is the treatment of non-volatile magnetic media following sanitization according to the ACSC ISM?
A: Due to concerns with the sanitization process for non-volatile magnetic media, SECRET and TOP SECRET non-volatile magnetic media retains its classification following sanitization.

Additionally, physical damage to the media through deformation of internal plates should occur after the use of a degausser. The process should be supervised by someone who holds appropriate clearance levels.
 
Q: What are some requirements regarding the destruction of media according to the ACSC ISM?
A: The ACSC ISM requires that all media must be handled securely throughout its lifecycle, including during its destruction process. To this effect, the ISM specifies several controls related to the destruction of media. These include:
* Media must be disposed of in accordance with approved policies (ISM-0370)
* Personnel performing the destruction of media must be cleared to handle its sensitivity or classification (ISM-0370)
* Supervision of the destruction of media must occur until completion (ISM-0371)
* Accountable materials require additional oversight during their destruction (ISM-0372)
* Only certain types of media may be outsourced for destruction (ISM-0839 & ISM-0840)
* Organisations must develop, implement and maintain processes and procedures for media disposal (ISM-0374)
* Labels and markings identifying the media's owner, sensitivity, classification etc., must be removed before dispos
 
Q: What does it mean when labels and markings are removed before media is disposed?
A: Labels and markings indicate the owner, sensitivity, classification or any other marking that can associate media with its prior use. Removing these labels ensures that information contained within the media cannot be used for unauthorised purposes after disposal.

Q: What are some guidelines for gateways?
A: The Australian Government provides several guidelines for gateways including the Guidelines for Gateways (March 2023).
 
Q: What are some key considerations for gateways?
A: Gateways are critical for an organization to reduce the security risks associated with providing external parties with access to its networks. When implementing gateways between an organization's networks and public network infrastructure, an organization should place any services that external parties require access to within a demilitarized zone. This can mitigate security risks for an organization when hosting such services in an internet-accessible manner. Finally, in architecting gateways, it is important that they only allow explicitly authorized data flows.
 
Q: What are some ways to improve the security of gateways?
A: System administrators for gateways must follow several best practices to maintain the integrity of gateways. These include ensuring that gateways are managed via a secure path isolated from all connected networks, using separate systems for each network, and implementing authentication mechanisms such as passwords and biometrics.
 
Q: What does Control:ISM-0619 state about users accessing other networks?
A: It says that users authenticate to other networks accessed via gateways.
 
Q: What are some examples of cross domain solutions?
A: There are many types of cross domain solutions including transfer and access cross domain solutions. A transfer cross domain solution allows data to flow uni-directionally or bi-directionally across different security domains. An access cross domain solution provides users with access to multiple security domains from a single device but does not allow them to move data between those domains.
 
Q: What does Control: ISM-0597 state about connecting to Cloud Data Services (CDS)?
A: When planning, designing, implementing or introducing additional connectivity to CDSs, the ACSC is consulted and any directions provided by the ACSC are complied with. Separation of data flows To ensure that data flows are appropriately controlled within CDSs, it is important that isolated upward and downward network paths are implemented. This, in turn, should be supported by independent security-enforcing functions and protocol breaks at each network layer. Cross Domain Solutions Event Logging CDSs should have comprehensive event logging capabilities to ensure accountability of users for all activities they undertake. Furthermore, effective event logging and monitoring practices can increase the likelihood that operational failures will be detected. In addition, CDS event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of CDSs, detecting malicious behavior and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, CDS event logs should be captured and stored centrally. User Training To assist in preventing cyber security incidents, it is important
 
Q: What further information about event logging can be found in the event logging and monitoring section of the Guidelines for System Monitoring?

Q: What type of controls does the ACSC ISM recommend when it comes to Content Filters?
A: The ACSC ISM recommends several controls related to Content Filtering including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Encrypted Files - Encrypted files should be decrypted in order to undergo content filtering checks.
\item Archive Files - Archived files can be used to bypass content filtering checks if content filters do not handle such files correctly. Ensuring content filters recognize archive files will ensure the embedded files they contain are subject to the same content filtering checks as un-archived files.
\item Antivirus Scan - Antivirus scans can be used to detect malicious files. Multiple different scanners should be used to increase the likelihood of identifying any malicious files.
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What is Content Validation according to the ACSC ISM?
A: Content validation, such as file format checks, aims to ensure that files conform to defined file format specifications. In performing content validation, any malformed content may indicate the presence of unauthorized content or malicious code, such as that designed to exploit known security vulnerabilities in operating systems or applications.

Q: What is multi-factor authentication?
A: Multi-factor authentication adds another layer of protection beyond passwords alone. It requires two or more pieces of evidence before granting access to a system. This could be something like a password plus a code sent via SMS message, or it could require a physical token such as a USB key.
 
Q: What are some ways to protect your online accounts?
A: There are many different methods you can employ to help keep your account safe. One way is through multi-factor authentication which requires more than one method of verification before allowing access to an account. This could be something like entering a code sent via SMS message, using a physical token such as a key fob or card reader, or even biometrics such as fingerprint scanning. Another option is two factor authentication whereby you require both knowledge of information about the account and possession of a device to gain entry. For example, if someone were trying to log into your email they would first need to know your password but also have access to your phone so they could receive a text message containing a unique code.
 
Q: What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?
A: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is when you use two or more different types of actions to verify your identity.
 
Q: What is Biometric Authentication?
A: With biometrics, your unique characteristics become the authenticator. An example of biometrics is using your face or fingerprint to access your device or mobile apps. Using biometrics as MFA is convenient, because they are always with you and cannot be misplaced or forgotten.
 
Q: What can I do to keep my online accounts safe?
A: Keep up to date. Ensure that any alternative authentication methods such as your recovery email addresses are at least as secure as the primary ones that you use to log into your accounts, and kept up to date. Remember to transfer your authenticator when you change devices. If you are using an authenticator app for MFA and you get a new device, make sure that you transfer it to your new device before disposing of, or resetting the old one. We recommend adding a recovery method to your account and saving your backup codes in case you lose access to your authenticator app, or delete it. In some cases, you might need to turn off MFA prior to getting a new device and reinstalling the authenticator app. Similarly, if you get a new phone number, make sure that before you lose access to your old phone number, you update your sign-in options for the accounts that normally rely on this number to send you an OTP by SMS.
 
Q: What resources are available to help me stay safe online?
A: This website provides a number of personal security guides which include tips on how to keep your devices up to date, how to create strong passwords, and what to look out for when using public WiFi networks. It also offers advice about phishing emails and scams, and how to avoid becoming a victim of identity fraud.
 
Q: What are some tips for securing my personal data when using public WiFi networks?
A: When connecting to public WiFi networks, it's important to ensure that all sensitive data such as passwords and credit card details are not transmitted over these connections. This can be done through the use of VPNs which encrypt traffic between your computer and the internet. It’s also recommended to avoid accessing banking websites while connected to public WiFi networks due to the increased risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.
 
Q: How can I protect myself against cyber threats?
A: The Australian Government recommends taking the following actions to improve your personal cyber security:
\begin{itemize}
\item Activating two factor authentication (also known as multifactor authentication) on your online accounts such as email and social media. This helps prevent unauthorised access to your account even if someone knows your password.
\end{itemize}
 
Q: Before you begin: you should read the Personal cyber security: First steps guide and activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) on your most important accounts (online banking and email). Why should I activate MFA on all of my accounts?
A: Using MFA on your accounts makes them much harder for cybercriminals to access. Cybercriminals might manage to steal one authentication type (such as your password), but they still need to obtain and use the other MFA method(s) to successfully access your account, requiring extra time, effort and resources.

This makes it difficult to distinguish between genuine requests and those intended to deceive.
 
Q: What are some things I can do to reduce my exposure to spam?
A: Other steps you can take to limit spam include reading the website privacy policy - it will tell you how they will use the personal information you provide. When signing up for an online account or service, be aware of default options to receive additional emails about other products and services. Suspicious email in your inbox can contain malware so think carefully before clicking on links or opening attachments. Don't reply to or forward chain letters you receive by email. Think carefully before clicking on links or opening attachments. Before you click a link, hover over that link to see the actual web address it will take you to (usually shown at the bottom of the browser window). If you do not recognize or trust the address, try searching for relevant key terms in a web browser. This way you can find the article, video, or webpage without directly clicking on the suspicious link. Ensure you have up-to-date antivirus software installed on any device used to access email. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is one of the most effective ways to protect your valuable information and accounts against unaut

\begin{itemize}
\item Keeping software up to date – This includes operating system updates, application patches, firmware updates etc.
\item Ensuring all users have strong passwords which they change regularly
\item Enabling two factor authentication where possible
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What is a smart place?
A: A smart place is a location where multiple technological systems and devices are connected to each other through ICT. These systems and devices are used to gather data about the environment and coordinate activities within the space. This allows for more efficient operations and improved quality of life for those who live there.
 
Q: What are the security risks in smart places?
A: Smart places create efficiencies for users, provide finer control and oversight of the place's operations to its implementers, and present an increased risk profile. The highly connected nature of a smart place increases efficiency while creating opportunities for cyberattacks. The interconnectivity of systems and devices at scale compounds existing security risks in individual technologies, enabling pivots between previously separate infrastructures and resulting in an overall larger attack surface. The storage of aggregated or sensitive data and potential connections to critical systems, including critical infrastructure, make smart places an even more attractive target for adversaries. System failures in smart places could have significant consequences, even without the involvement of adversaries, due to poor requirements gathering, design, engineering or simple misadventure. For a smart place, this could arise from the connection of legacy equipment, opaque distribution of responsibility and abstract lines of ownership. Through malicious or non-malicious activity, disruptions of a single service may result in cascading effects to other systems, potentially leading to significant consequences for citizens. Implementers may

Q: What are some of the risks of moving to the cloud?
A: Moving to the cloud may introduce additional risks compared to managing your own IT infrastructure. Some of these include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduction in control over the underlying hardware and software components of the cloud system
\item Loss of transparency into the operations of the cloud provider
\item Increased complexity due to multiple parties involved in delivering the cloud service
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What are the advantages of moving to cloud computing over self-managing your IT infrastructure?
A: Organizations who manage and secure their own Information Technology (IT) infrastructure, such as an on-premise environment, need to consider as part of their risk assessment of cloud computing, the risks of not transitioning to cloud computing. An organization who owns and manages its own IT infrastructure is responsible for securing all aspects of it, including achieving the desired security baseline, maintaining it and updating it as adversary tradecraft evolves; depending on the size of the environment, this may necessitate significant effort and resources on behalf of the organization to achieve this. As part of an organizations' examination of cloud computing, they need to consider their own capabilities to secure their systems and protect their information from current and future cyber threats. If an organization's basic security practices such as patching, upgrading and system hardening are ineffective or inconsistent, cloud computing may provide significant security improvements. By transferring some security responsibilities to the CSP, an organization can prioritize other, more specific security mitigations such
 
Q: What does adopting cloud computing require a degree of trust given to the CSP to handle a cloud consumer's data?
A: Adopting cloud computing requires a degree of trust given to the CSP to handle a cloud consumer's data because they may need to transfer sensitive information to the CSP's cloud services.
 
Q: What measures can be taken to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data by CSP's employees?
A: There are several ways to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data by CSP's employees. Firstly, separation of duties between staff members with different levels of authorization can help prevent malicious activity. Secondly, encrypting all data at rest and in transit helps protect data even if someone does gain access to it. Thirdly, secure key management ensures that only authorized users can decrypt encrypted data. Fourthly, real-time monitoring allows organizations to identify suspicious behavior immediately. Fifthly, providing customers with the option to control which resources they grant access to reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access. Finally, contractual agreements requiring disclosure of breaches allow companies to take action promptly after discovering a problem.
 
Q: What are the requirements for temporary access to security classified information?
A: The PSPF Access to Information Policy provides a mechanism for Australian government entities to grant temporary access to classified information in some limited circumstances. Temporary access may be provided up to and including SECRET for personnel without a security clearance, after the risks of doing so have been assessed.
 
Q: What are some examples of Australian government entities having to supervise temporary access?
A: Some examples of Australian government entities having to supervise temporary access includes escorting visitors in premises where classified information is being stored or used, management oversight of the work of personnel who have the temporary access, monitoring or audit logging incidents of contact with security classified information (e.g. contract conditions that require service providers to report when any of their contractors have had contact with classified information)
 
Q: What does the Attorney General's department require before allowing temporary access to classified information?
A: A risk assessment must consider the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Need for temporary access, including if the role can be performed by someone who already holds the necessary clearance
\item Confirmation from the authorized vetting agency that the person has no identified security concerns, or a clearance that has been cancelled or denied
\item Quantum and classification level of information that could be accessed, and the potential business impact if this information were compromised
\item How access to classified information will be supervised, including how access to caveated or compartmentalized information will be prevented
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about sharing reports between cloud consumers?
A: Cloud consumers whose ASA performs this assessment are recommended to share their report with other cloud consumers who are considering using the same CSP.
 
Q: What factors should cloud consumers take into consideration when choosing a Cloud Service Provider?
A: When selecting a Cloud Service Provider, it's important to understand how they manage their business and what level of security measures they implement. You should look at the location of the company, whether they are locally owned or if there are any foreign investments involved. It's also worthwhile looking at the physical location of the servers hosting your data - you want them to be hosted within Australia so that they aren't vulnerable to foreign governments accessing your data without permission.
 
Q: What is the purpose of the ACSC ISM?
A: The purpose of the ISM is to outline a cyber security framework that organizations can apply, using their risk management framework, to protect their information and systems from cyber threats.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about sharing responsibility for cloud security?
A: The ACSC ISM says that cloud security is a shared responsibility between the CSP, the cloud consumer and any other third-parties who are involved in providing the complete cloud solution. As part of this, cloud consumers need to understand their responsibilities, as well as the responsibilities of the other parties involved in delivering the complete cloud solution.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about the importance of performing an IRAP assessment of the underlying CSP and its cloud services?
A: If an IRAP assessment of the underlying CSP and its cloud services has not been performed, this may make it difficult for cloud consumers to understand the risks of using a third-party cloud solution.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about conducting security assessments of outsourced cloud service providers?
A: Outsourced cloud service providers and their cloud services must undergo regular security assessments by an IRAP assessor to determine their security posture and security risks associated with their use.
 
Q: What are some key factors when scoping a cloud security assessment?
A: Scoping of the cloud security assessment is an important step that helps identify expected authorisation boundaries and the limit of significant dependencies and responsibilities. It also creates abstraction layers that allow systems to be individually identified and described without necessarily having to describe all other related components simultaneously. Experience with cloud assessments indicates that it is difficult to correctly determine scope at the outset. While IRAP assessors and CSPs should determine an initial scope, this scope should be regularly reviewed to ensure it remains representative of the assessment. In particular, if significant dependencies, potential weaknesses or significant sources of risk are identified which are beyond the initial scope, then the scope should be adjusted.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about reusing evidence and inheriting controls?
A: Cloud consumers and CSPs may seek to rely on other ISM based cloud assessments in order to inherit effective controls from those assessments. For example, a CSP who offers SaaS may seek to inherit controls from another CSP's IaaS. Acknowledging the inheritance of controls can be an efficient strategy but care needs to be taken to ensure that later assessments do not try and claim controls which do not provide coverage against the full operating context of the later assessment. Before accepting the inheritance of a control, IRAP assessors need to consider whether the new operating context is fully covered by a control considered in a prior assessment.
 
Q: What does the IRAP assessor expertise principle state about the complexity of a cloud environment?
A: A cloud environment presents a complex technology stack that can involve multiple parties responsible for the end-to-end solution. This creates a uniquely challenging solution to assess, and necessitates a suitably qualified and skilled assessor, such as an IRAP assessor to perform the assessment.
 
Q: What does the first phase of the ACSC ISM entail?
A: The first phase of the ACSC ISM involves the cloud consumer determining whether the CSP meets its security requirements and risk tolerances. If it does, they proceed to Phase 2. In Phase 1a, the CSP's security fundamentals and in-scope cloud services are assessed by an IRAP assessor.
 
Q: What are some examples of administrative and support environments?
A: Examples include physical security, network segmentation and segregation, system hardening, secure administration, etc.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about protecting data at rest?
A: Data protection includes ensuring confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability, traceability, auditability, authenticity, nonrepudiation, and resilience. It also covers data backups and recovery procedures.
 
What is the purpose of a Phase 1b cloud service assessment?
The purpose of a Phase 1b cloud service assessment is to provide a quicker way for cloud consumers to evaluate whether a particular cloud service meets their security needs without having to wait for a full Phase 1a assessment to be conducted.
 
Q: What does phase two of the ACSC ISM entail?
A: Phase Two involves conducting an assessment of the cloud consumer's own cloud systems. This assessment can either be done internally by the cloud consumer themselves or externally through an IRAP assessor. Once complete, it must be approved by the cloud consumer's Authorizing Officer (or their delegate) who reviews the Cloud Authorization Package containing the CSP's cloud security assessment report, and if applicable, any supplementary, new or updated cloud services reports, along with the cloud consumer's cloud systems report.
 
Q: What is the shared responsibility model for each cloud service?
A: It depends on the configuration of a cloud consumer's systems. If the configuration alters the original shared responsibility model documented in the cloud security assessment report, then responsibilities might transfer between the CSP and the cloud consumer.
 
Q: What measures can help organisations proactively monitor and manage security vulnerabilities in systems?
A: Measures such as continuous monitoring and assurance plans can provide organisations with valuable information about their exposure to cyber threats, as well as assist them to determine security risks associated with the operation of their systems.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about Maintaining the CSP security fundamentals and cloud services report?
A: The IRAP assessor provides the final cloud security assessment report to the CSP who is responsible for maintaining the accuracy and currency of the report between independent assessments by adding addendums to the report. Addenda must detail any changes, deviations, corrections and clarifications required to maintain the accuracy and currency of the report, including the Cloud Controls Matrix.
 
Q: What are some related CSP security fundamentals and cloud services report addendums?
A: Continually disclosing information to cloud consumers will enable them to make timely, risk-informed decisions about the operation of their systems and the protection of data, them to efficiently identify and respond to any risks deemed unacceptable.
 
Q: What does the Cyber Skills Framework provide?
A: The Cyber Skills Framework provides information about the skills required to work in the field of cyber security. It also includes details about training courses available to develop these skills.

To mitigate basic cyber threats: Internet facing services - Daily Workstations, Servers, Network Devices & Other Network Connected Devices – Fortnightly To mitigate moderate cyber threats: Internet facing services - Daily Workstations, Servers, Network Devices & Other Network Connected Devices – Weekly To mitigate advanced cyber threats: Internet facing services - Daily Workstations, Servers, Network Devices & Other Network Connected Devices – Weekly
 
Q: What considerations should be taken into account when applying patches during change freeze periods?
A: Patching during change freeze periods requires careful consideration because of the increased risk of introducing unexpected issues. It's therefore essential to understand how your organisation handles change freezes and whether they include exceptions for urgent patching. You must also know which patches you absolutely cannot miss (e.g., those addressing zero day vulnerabilities) and which ones can wait until after the freeze ends.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about temporary workarounds?
A: The ACSC ISM recommends implementing temporary workarounds until vendor patches become available.
 
Q: What is Patch Management?
A: Patch management refers to the processes and procedures needed to manage the maintenance, upgrading, and updating of software applications within an organization. It includes defining which updates should be applied, when they should be installed, who should install them, and what problems might occur if they aren't installed.

Q: What are the potential advantages of moving publicly available data to the public cloud?
A: There may be good business reasons to move publicly available data to the public cloud. If properly designed, a vendor's spare network bandwidth and spare computing capacity automatically helps to mitigate some types of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Technologies such as 'anycast' and international Content Delivery Networks (CDN) can help to mitigate DDoS attacks by geographically distributing the network traffic and computer processing around the world. These technologies to improve the availability and business continuity of publicly available data are prohibitively expensive for every organization to build themselves, though are relatively inexpensive to rent from vendors.
 
Q: What are some common security concerns when considering moving your data to the Cloud?
A: When considering moving your data to the Cloud there are several security concerns you must take into account. These include ensuring that your data remains available and functional, keeping your data safe from unauthorized access, and making sure that your data isn't compromised due to actions taken by others who share the same infrastructure.
 
Q: What are some security considerations when choosing a cloud provider?
A: Visitors to the vendor's data centers must be positively identified and escorted. Vendors' data centers must have cable management practices to identify tampering. The vendor's security considerations must apply equally to its subcontractors. Handling security incidents - The vendor must be contactable and provide timely responses and support. I must review the vendor's security incident response plan. The vendor's employees must be trained to detect and handle security incidents. The vendor must notify me of security incidents. The vendor must assist me with security investigations and legal discovery. I must be able to access audit logs and other evidence to perform a forensic investigation. I must receive adequate compensation for a security breach caused by the vendor. Storage media storing sensitive data can be adequately sanitized. Detailed cloud computing security considerations - This section provides a detailed list of security considerations that organizations can discuss both internally and with vendors that are transparent about their security measures. Some examples are provided to demonstrate that the security considerations are not theoretical. Questions are
 
Q: What factors should you consider when evaluating your network connectivity to the cloud?
A: You should evaluate whether your network connectivity to the cloud is adequate in terms of availability, traffic throughput (bandwidth), delays (latency) and packet loss.
 
Q: What factors affect the speed of recovery after deleting files, emails or other data?
A: When you accidentally delete a file, email or other data, your data needs to be recovered quickly so that you don't lose important work. To minimize downtime, consider backing up your data regularly and choosing a cloud provider who offers fast restore times.
 
Q: Media Sanitation - What processes are used to sanitize the storage media storing my data at its end of life, and are the processes deemed appropriate by the ISM?
A: The ISM requires that media sanitization procedures must be documented and implemented to ensure that sensitive information stored on media is destroyed prior to disposal. This includes physical destruction methods such as degaussing, shredding, incinerating, pulverizing, melting, crushing, etc., or logical destruction methods such as overwriting, encryption, or deletion.

Q: Vendor's Remote Monitoring & Management - Does the vendor monitor, administer or manage the computers that store or process my data? If so, is this performed remotely from foreign countries or from Australia? Can the vendor provide patch compliance reports and other details about the security of workstations used to perform this work, and what controls prevent the vendor's employees from using untrustworthy personally owned laptops?
A: The ISM requires that vendors who provide remote administration capabilities must implement adequate safeguards to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access
 
Q: Auditing the vendor's IT security posture. A: Yes, ISM-1638 states that auditors must verify whether the vendor implements appropriate security measures, including performing scans and other penetration tests of the environment provided to them.

Q: Which reputable third parties have performed audits and other vulnerability assessments? A: The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) performs independent verification and validation activities against vendors who supply information technology products and services to government agencies.

Q: What sort of internal audits does the vendor perform, and what compliance standards and other recommended practices from organizations like CSA are used for these assessments? A: Vendors conduct periodic self-assessments based on industry best practice guidelines and frameworks such as the ASD Information Security Manual (ISM), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 27000 series, and the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA).
 
Q: Weakening my security posture. How would using the vendor's cloud infrastructure weaken my organization's existing network security posture?
A: Using the vendor's cloud infrastructure would increase your attack surface because you would not own the hardware and software running within the cloud environment. The vendor might also offer additional features that allow them to monitor your traffic and collect information about your usage patterns.

Q: Would the vendor advertise me as one of their customers without my explicit consent, thereby assisting an adversary that is specifically targeting me?
A: It depends on how much information they share publicly. If they publish lists of clients, then yes, this could happen. However, if they don't disclose client names, then there wouldn't be anything for an adversary to go after.

Q: For example, an adversary could use cloud infrastructure from the same vendor used by the target organization, to both serve malicious web content to the organization's users, and to exfiltrate the organization's sensitive data.

Q: What is DNSSEC?
A: DNSSEC is a set of extensions to Domain Name System (DNS), which allows clients to authenticate information received via DNS. It prevents man-in-the middle attacks and ensures integrity of DNS records.
 
Q: What is DNS over TLS / DNS over HTTPS?
A: If an organization has opted to use an external DNS provider, they can provide cryptographic confidentiality by implementing DNS over TLS (DoT) or DNS over HTTPS (DoH). DoT encapsulates DNS within Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is similar to how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol can be encapsulated within TLS to make HTTPS. In networks where DoT is unsupported, DNS requests can be sent over HTTPS to provide a comparable level of security. DoT currently has limited adoption, while DoH adoption has begun to climb with the implementation of DoH by web browsers, including Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. While an improvement to security for individual users, organizations should ensure that web browsers are configured to disable DoH within their own networks for monitoring purposes, and implement DNS request encryption for DNS queries that traverse external networks. Organizations that utilize external DNS resolvers should consider using a DoT capable DNS forwarder to provide DoT for all outbound DNS resolver queries. Details on how to provision this service can be found on the DNS Privacy Project Wiki
 
Q: How does using DNS encryption affect user's ability to access restricted websites?
A: Incomplete DNS monitoring poses a potential risk of allowing users to bypass DNS-based security filters and content management. This can occur when users request information from external DNS resolvers that provide a DoH interface. Without a TLS termination proxy, it is impossible to monitor DoH DNS requests.

It is recommended to disable DoH via Group Policy in enterprise environments, however, rapid adoption is expected in BYOD environments and on misconfigured or un-configured web browsers.
Adoption of DoH may result in the bypassing of content restrictions, including for offensive material and inappropriate use of organizational resources. This can also potentially evade attempts to block downloading of malware through DNS filtering.

Q: How can you configure Microsoft Office macro security settings in the Trust Center?
A: Open each Microsoft Office application and attempt to change Microsoft Office macro security settings in the Trust Center. If Microsoft Office macro security settings have been configured via group policy settings, they should appear greyed out.
 
Q: Web browser security settings cannot be changed by users. What does this mean?
A: It means that Internet Explorer 11 and Mozilla Firefox browsers have grayed out security settings which indicate that these settings have been configured via group policy settings and cannot be changed by users. Additionally, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome browsers show icons with hover messages saying "This setting is managed by your organization" and "This setting is managed by your administrator", respectively, indicating that these settings have been configured via group policy settings and cannot be changed by users.
 
Q: What happens if you attempt to logon to a privileged workstation using a standard user account?
A: Attempting to logon to a privileged environment using a standard user account would result in failure. Privileged accounts (excluding local administrator accounts) cannot logon to unprivileged operating environments.
 
Q: What is a vulnerability scanner?
A: A vulnerability scanner is a software application designed to automatically detect vulnerabilities in computer systems. It uses automated scripts to probe a target host for potential weaknesses such as misconfigurations, open ports, and obsolete software. Vulnerability scanners typically run on dedicated hardware appliances or virtual machines. They may also be installed directly onto hosts running operating systems like Linux or Microsoft Windows.

Q: How often should I perform a vulnerability scan?
A: You should conduct a vulnerability scan at least once per week. However, you might want to increase your frequency based on risk factors specific to your environment. For example, if you operate critical infrastructure, you could choose to perform more frequent scans than other organisations.

Q: Can I use a vulnerability scanner without a subscription?
A: Many commercial vendors offer free trials so you can test drive their products. If you don't find what you're looking for there, try searching online for "free vulnerability scanner". Some examples include nmap, w3af, and Nikto.
 
Q: What tools can be used to check whether patches have been installed correctly?
A: Network-based vulnerability scanners such as the Australian Cyber Security Centre's E8 Mitigation Toolset (E8MVT) can be used to identify operating systems, their versions and installation dates. These details can then be reviewed alongside the release date of the patches to determine whether the timeframe has been met. Free tools like E8MVT can quickly determine patches that have been applied, which can then be compared to the patch release date. Paid tools are also available. When selecting a tool, make sure that it has been thoroughly tested first to ensure it is fit-for-purpose. If using WSUS for the assessment of this control, it is important to consider that WSUS does not necessarily report accurate patch levels. Specifically, WSUS reports patches or updates that have been deployed but not whether they were successfully applied, stuck and if the machine was rebooted (if required).

Q: How can you tell if patches have been properly implemented?
A: Patches, updates or vendor mitigations for security vulner
 
Q: What is Multi-Factor Authentication?
A: Multi-Factor Authentication is one of the most effective controls an organization can implement to prevent adversaries from gaining access to a system, service or application.
 
Q: What are the best practices around backing up Internet facing services?
A: Backups of important data, software and configuration settings must be performed and retained with a frequency and retention timeframe in accordance with business continuity requirements. Synchronized backups are also required to allow for easy restoration to a common point in time. Restorations of important data, software and configuration settings from backups to a common point in time must be tested as part of disaster recovery exercises. Unprivileged accounts should not be allowed to access backups belonging to other accounts.
 
Q: What does Unprivileged accounts cannot access backups belonging to other accounts mean according to the ACSC ISM?
A: It means that unprivileged accounts cannot access backups belonging to other accounts.

A: The ACSC's E8MVT can help you determine whether your organization has implemented this control. It also recommends that blocked PowerShell script execution events should be logged.
 
Q: What is the purpose of Control ISM-1689?
A: The purpose of ISM-1689 is to ensure that Privileged Access Management controls are applied consistently across government agencies.
 
Q: What does it mean when auditing sensitive privileges is enabled?
A: Enabling 'Audit Sensitive Privilege Use' enables logging of all attempts to gain elevated permissions. This includes successful logins using administrative credentials, failed login attempts, and other actions such as changing passwords.
 
Q: What are the requirements for Multi Factor Authentication according to the ACSC ISM?
A: At this maturity level, an additional requirement for all privileged users logging onto systems, both locally and remotely, to use multi-factor authentication is introduced. In addition, the authentication methods that can be used, and in what combination, are restricted to avoid weaker implementations. Specifically, acceptable multi-factor authentication implementations include:
 
Q: What is Multi-Factor Authentication?
A: Multi-Factor Authentication uses either: something you have and something you know, or something you have that is unlocked by something you know or are. It requires two or more pieces of information to verify your identity before granting access to resources.
 
Q: What is the focus of Maturity Level Three according to the ACSC ISM?
A: The focus of this maturity level is adversaries who are more adaptive and much less reliant on public tools and techniques. These adversaries are able to exploit the opportunities provided by weaknesses in their target's cyber security posture, such as the existence of older operating systems or inadequate logging and monitoring.
 
Q: What does Application Control require?
A: At this maturity level, Application Control restricts the execution of executables, software libraries, scripts, installers, compiled HTML, HTML applications, control panel applets and drivers to an organization approved set.
 
Q: What steps must be taken to ensure the safe execution of Microsoft Office macros?
A: Use the relevant guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity Level Three timeframes when exploits exist for security vulnerabilities. Applications that are no longer supported by vendors are removed. Configure Microsoft Office macro settings Context Disabling the use of Microsoft Office macros represents an optimal security outcome, however, some users will have a business requirement for their use. In such situations, additional controls should be implemented to make the use of Microsoft Office macros as secure as possible. This may include either running Microsoft Office macros from within a sandboxed environment, from an appropriately controlled Trusted Location or ensuring they are digitally signed by a trusted publisher. As Microsoft Office allows any files that are opened from a Trusted Location to bypass security checks, it is critical that only trusted users can write to or modify content in these locations. Under no circumstances should Trusted Locations be specified within a user's profile, such as their desktop or documents folders. If the 'Disable all macros except digitally signed macros' setting is used, this
 
Q: What are some steps involved in the assessment of Microsoft Office macro security?
A: Within each Microsoft Office application, request a screenshot showing Trust Center macro settings (File - Options - Trust Center - Trust Center Settings - Macro Settings). In addition, request a screenshot showing Trust Center trusted publisher settings (File - Options - Trust Center - Trust Center Settings - Trusted Publishers).
For the assessment of Microsoft Office macro security, identify what setting is selected for 'Macro Settings'. The setting should either be set to 'Disable all macros without notification' (if Trusted Locations are used) or 'Disable all macros except digitally signed macros' (if digitally signed Microsoft Office macros are used). For the assessment of Trusted Locations, check whether the 'Disable all trusted locations' option has been checked or not. If it has not, then Trusted Locations are enabled and should be individually assessed for their suitability. Only privileged users responsible for validating that Microsoft Office macros are free of malicious code can write to and modify content within Trusted Locations.
 
Q: Discuss whether a SIEM solution is appropriately configured for the protection of event logs.
A: A SIEM solution monitors event logs for signs of compromise and alerts administrators when such events occur. The configuration of the SIEM solution determines how effective it is at detecting these events.

Q: Discuss whether a SIEM solution supported by SOC analysts is used to monitor event logs for signs of compromise and respond when any signs of compromise are detected.
A: A SIEM solution supported by SOC analysts uses advanced analytics to identify patterns within event log data and generate alerts when anomalous activity occurs. These analysts then investigate the alerts generated by the SIEM solution and take appropriate actions based on their findings.
 
Q: What is PowerShell?
A: PowerShell is a cross-platform automation and configuration tool built on.NET Framework. It allows you to manage your computer from the command line interface.

Q: How does PowerShell work?
A: PowerShell uses cmdlets to execute commands. Cmdlets are specialized functions that provide specific tasks such as creating files, managing processes, etc. You can also create custom scripts called modules. Modules contain multiple cmdlets that help you accomplish various tasks.

Q: Why would I want to enable constrained language mode?
A: Enabling constrained language mode prevents malicious code from executing. If you run a script containing malware, enabling constrained language mode will block its execution. However, if you trust the source of the script, then disabling constrained language mode might make sense.

Q: Is there anything else I should know about PowerShell?
A: PowerShell supports both local and remote sessions. The default behavior is to connect remotely but you can change this setting through the registry editor.
 
Q: What are some of the key considerations for Patching Operating Systems?
A: At this maturity level, patches, updates or vendor mitigations for security vulnerabilities in operating systems of workstations, servers and network devices are required to be applied within two weeks of release, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists. Modern operating systems for workstations, servers and network devices often contain security functionality that is not available in earlier releases, even if those earlier releases remain supported by vendors. It is important that an organization takes advantage of new security functionality in later releases to further mitigate adversary activities. The latest release of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Server will depend on the servicing branch being used. Further release information is available from Microsoft. Similar information is often available from vendors of network devices.
 
Q: What are some ways to protect your computer from malware?
A: Patches, updates or vendor mitigations for security vulnerabilities in operating systems of workstations, servers and network devices are applied within two weeks of release, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists. Use the relevant guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity Level Three timeframes when exploits exist for security vulnerabilities. The latest release, or the previous release, of operating systems are used. Network-based vulnerability scanners can be used to identify operating systems and their versions. The output of these tools can then be used to check against the latest operating system versions available from vendors. For Microsoft Windows workstations and servers, the 'winver' command can be run to determine the version of the operating system. Request a screenshot of the output of running the 'winver' command for servers and workstations (assuming a Standard Operating Environment is used for workstations). Multi-factor authentication Context At this maturity level, all users accessing important data repositories should be using multi-factor authentication. Furthermore, the types and combinations of multi
 
Q: Discuss whether a SIEM solution is appropriately configured for the protection of event logs.
A: A SIEM solution monitors event logs for signs of compromise and alerts administrators when anomalies occur. It also allows administrators to take appropriate actions based on these alerts. Therefore, a SIEM solution is appropriately configured for the protection of event logs.

Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about adversarial capabilities at different maturity levels?
A: The focus of Maturity Level One is adversaries operating with little or no knowledge of how to operate against a specific target. They tend to rely heavily on automated tools and known vulnerabilities. At Maturity Level Two, adversaries are willing to invest more time in a target and, perhaps more importantly, in the effectiveness of their tools. For example, these adversaries will likely employ well-known tradecraft in order to better attempt to bypass security controls implemented by a target and evade detection. This includes actively targeting credentials using phishing and employing technical and social engineering techniques to circumvent weak multi-factor authentication.
At Maturity Level Three, adversaries are more adaptive and much less reliant on public tools and techniques. These adversaries are able to exploit the opportunities provided by weaknesses in their target's cyber security posture, such as the existence of older software or inadequate logging and monitoring. Adversaries do this to not only extend their access once initial access has been gained to a target,

Q: Why was Maturity Level Zero reintroduced?
A: Maturity Level Zero has been reintroduced to the Essential Eight Maturity Model to provide a broader range of maturity level ratings for assessors to consider when evaluating Essential Eight implementations.

Q: How is the maturity model moving to a stronger risk-based approach to implementation?
A: There will be circumstances (such as legacy systems and technical debt) that may prevent immediate or full implementation of requirements within the Essential Eight Maturity Model. In such cases, risk management processes may adequately address this.

Q: How can the mitigation strategies be implemented as a package?
A: Organizations previously implemented each of the mitigation strategies individually. This approach was seen as leading to an imbalanced cyber security posture when resources were used implementing a few mitigation strategies to higher maturity levels while other mitigation strategies were not addressed, or addressed at a lower maturity level. Achieving a maturity level as a package will provide a more secure baseline than achieving higher
 
Q: What changes were made to 'Configure Microsoft Office Macro Settings'?
A: To lower an organization's attack surface, all maturity levels were updated to recommend that macros are disabled for all users who do not have a demonstrated business requirement for their use.

Q
 
Q: How can I find out if a security vulnerability has an exploit or not?
A: The ACSC, vendors, news outlets and security researchers often cover exploitable security vulnerabilities. Do I have 48 hours to patch from when exploits are announced or when exploitation starts occurring? The requirement to patch within 48 hours 'if an exploit exists' relates to the announcement of an exploit or that exploitation is already occurring, whichever occurs first. I'm unable to perform rapid scanning and patching of internet-facing services, what can I do? The ACSC encourages all organizations to consider moving their internet-facing services to mature and trustworthy cloud service providers. Depending on the type of cloud service used, this can result in significant security benefits such as the rapid identification and patching of security vulnerabilities.

Q: What is Cross Domain Solutions?
A: Cross Domain Solutions enable organizations to share information across physically, logically and administratively separated networks in a reliable, secure and interoperable manner.
 
Q: Why is a Cross Domain System (CDS) special?
A: CDS systems are an example of technological convergence where discrete security concepts and technologies are carefully combined within a comprehensive system architecture to protect sensitive, critical and classified networks. Unlike a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) network gateway, such as those used in lower risk applications, a CDS is an advanced gateway systems that employs a wide range of overlapping security controls to provide assured data flows and defense-in-depth.
 
Q: What are some high level cross domain security considerations?
A: High level cross domain security considerations include determining the most critical security properties and security functionality for a CDS and connected systems, prior to commencing design or acquisition. It's also important to understand the risks inherent to the data that will be transferred, and ensure security policy enforcement meets those risks. Recognise that security functionality may exist in a single appliance or be distributed across multiple components in a CDS or adjacent systems. Ensure design and implementation assurance requirements, including physical and personnel controls, are proportional to the criticality of the system. Tailor a CDS to address the unique security and business environment. Block all data flows by default and only allow known good data to pass based on predefined rules. Consider each layer of the OSI Model of Networking (as well as the human factor).
 
Q: What are some common threats to Cross Domain Systems?
A: Threats to Cross Domain Systems can come from both external sources and internal sources. External threats can include issue motivated groups trying to disrupt or embarrass government organizations or multinational companies. State sponsored groups can attempt espionage on behalf of foreign entities. Cybercriminals can try to gain access to valuable information stored in these systems. Internal threats can occur when authorized users make mistakes while accessing the system. Malicious or deceptive insiders can also pose a risk to the system. Other threats can arise due to the involvement of third parties like suppliers who develop the system.
 
Q: What are common cross domain risks when implementing a Cross Domain System?
A: When security controls for a CDS are inadequately enforced, connections between different security domains may allow threat actors to gain unauthorized access to steal, copy or interfere with information, establish covert channels (data paths not intended in the original design of the system), compromise the integrity of trusted systems or data, propagate by pivoting through less protected networks to access more sensitive systems, etc.
 
Q: What does it mean for a CDS to be implemented to a sufficient level of assurance?
A: It means that the CDS is designed and operated so that its security properties meet the needs of the organization using it. This includes having appropriate security controls in place, such as strong authentication, encryption, and auditing.
 
Q: What are some challenges when it comes to securing sensitive data?
A: Due to the effectively unlimited methods for encoding hidden data among valid data (i.e. steganography), a CDS handling complex data types is unlikely to eliminate the risk of data exfiltration entirely. A CDS can only reduce the bandwidth of covert data channels available to any given threat actor. Reliance on dirty word filtering alone will not stop malicious attempts at data exfiltration.
 
Q: What does "generally" mean in the sentence below?
A: Generally means usually, often, most of the time, etc.
 
Q: What does it mean if a security domain holds lower levels of integrity and confidentiality?
A: A security domain holding lower levels of integrity and confidentiality means that its security policies allow for greater accessibility than those of higher security domains. For instance, a security domain containing sensitive information would require stricter security policies than a non-sensitive domain.
 
Q: What is a security zone?
A: In networking, a security zone is a logical area in a network with a defined level of security. This security is typically defined relative to the security of another security zone such as the Internet (where there is zero trust). Security zones layered in this way are also known as trust zones, which are used as a mechanism for establishing defense-in-depth in a network design. Unlike a proper security domain, a security zone or trust zone may not have its own defined or enforced security policy. Rather, security enforcement will typically be limited to logical network separation and access control rules.
 
Q: What does the above diagram illustrate?
A: The above diagram illustrates how users with varying clearances can access certain resources depending on their clearance level.
 
Q: What are the functions of a CDS (Central Data Store)?
A: The central data store (CDS) provides an interface between the CDS core and each of the connected security domains, as well as any relevant management network planes. It accepts data from authenticated and authorized users and/or source systems for inspection and treatment. It presents filtered data in a usable form to approved destination systems and/or users. It maintains logical separation between connected security domains. Finally, it reduces the attack surface of the CDS core and the high side security domain.
 
Q: What does a Cross Domain Solution (CDS) do?
A: A CDS provides protection against unauthorised disclosure of information between different security domains. It allows authorized users within each domain to share information without compromising confidentiality.
 
Q: What are the types of Cross Domain Solutions (CDS)?
A: There are four main types of CDS: Transfer, Access, Multi-Level Security, and Enterprise.
 
Q: What is a Transfer CDS?
A: A Transfer CDS is a type of Cross Domain Solution that enables the exchange of data across security boundaries while maintaining confidentiality, integrity, authentication, nonrepudiation, and availability. It provides a means to share sensitive information among authorized parties without exposing it to unauthorized entities.
 
Q: What does MLS stand for?
A: Multi Level Security
 
Q: What are some ways a Cross Domain Solution (CDS) can help organisations share sensitive information while still ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability?
A: Detailed descriptions of how a CDS can achieve these cross domain security principles are described below.
\begin{itemize}
\item Context-appropriate security-enforcing mechanisms
\end{itemize}

A CDS will enforce a security policy, developed to meet an organization's information sharing requirements, whilst upholding the security and risk acceptance assumptions of the high side security domain. The security policy must consider the information being shared (i.e. the semantic content) and the data format used to convey that information (i.e. the syntax or syntactic structure). A CDS should validate all file content, and any other data, against a schema of known and expected traffic. Furthermore, a CDS will ensure all information, including data type, content, source and originator, is approved for release via conformance to the security policy or a securely implemented manual intervention process that reveals any hidden content to a knowledgeable reviewer. Further information on security
 
Q: What does a CDS do?
A: A CDS checks where data has originated to ensure it aligns with expectations and that provenance is maintained through any links between source and destination systems. It ensures data is not accessed or modified, except by trusted and approved users or processes. It supports best practice data-in-transit protection for all connections.
 
Q: What does the ACSC's Implementing Network Segmentation and Segregation publication say about CDS?
A: Further information can be found in the ACSC's Implementing Network Segmentation and Segregation publication. Pre-approved patterns A CDS will follow architecture patterns and/or design patterns, where approved and available to system developers, to ensure risks related to common security problems are addressed consistently and securely. Architecture patterns are being developed for a number of common business requirements and can be requested from the ACSC. Tailored solutions A CDS will be tailored to the specific business, operational and security requirements of CDS system owners. Although CDS components may be re-usable, particularly where pre-approved architecture or design patterns have been used, the risk assessment and risk acceptance activities relevant to one CDS are not automatically transferable to another. A tailored and considered risk assessment is necessary when expanding capabilities of a CDS beyond the specific well-understood use cases and threat environments which formed the basis of the original risk acceptance activities. Additionally, new use cases may also inadvertently reduce the security of
 
Q: What measures can be taken to protect against attacks targeting Data Path Optimization?
A: Data paths are optimized to address the specific threats to either high side confidentiality or integrity. For example, data moving from low side to high side security domains will typically be channelled through a different arrangement of security-enforcing mechanisms compared to data moving from high side to low side. CDS system architecture will also employ network segmentation and segregation internally, creating separation between security zones within CDS components to limit bypass of critical security-enforcement points. Movement between these security zones will be enforced by software and hardware firewalls as well as one way controls (e.g. one-way inter-process communication paths and hardware data diodes).
 
Q: What does Secure Administration mean according to the ACSC ISM?
A: Secure administration means managing configuration out-of-band or from the high side only, using data-in-transit encryption for administration sessions, authenticating all administrators and management interfaces, following general information security objectives of role separation with role-based access control and least-privilege, treating administrative actions as privileged access and auditing appropriately, implementing separation of duties such that no single person can alter the operation of components of a CDS from end to end (e.g. firewalls, CDS core components and auditing are administered by different people), accountability and detection, secure CDS implementation, self protection, secure failure.
 
Q: What does a CDS system owner need to do to properly manage a CDS?
A: A CDS system owner needs to implement several measures to properly manage a CDS including having a plan for managing component or system failures, making sure it doesn't operate in a degraded state, keeping its security transparent, providing no additional information to unauthorized parties, applying patches and updating systems, conducting periodic reviews, training users, educating users on proper usage, and more.
 
Q: Compared to normal cyber security practices, what makes Cross Domain Security (CDS) different?
A: Cross Domain Security (CDS) is designed to protect an organization's most sensitive or classified systems and information. Therefore, higher levels of assurance are needed compared to general cyber security practices. However, some organizations may choose to implement CDS due to legal obligations rather than operational necessity.
 
Q: What does conducting a security assessment entail?
A: Conducting a security assessment involves developing and reviewing the test plan, performing a vulnerability assessment to validate the security of the system’s design, and reporting findings. It also includes performing hands-on testing as necessary (typically comprising but not limited to penetration testing) to identify technical security vulnerabilities, and reporting findings. Finally, it requires formalising the residual risk and authorizing the system to operate.
 
Q: What are some examples of backdoors?
A: Backdoor can be defined as a way for someone who does not have authorized access into a system or network. Some common types of backdoors include:
* Hardware backdoor - A hardware backdoor is installed during manufacturing process which allows unauthorised access to the device. This type of backdoor cannot be detected using software tools.
* Software backdoor – A software backdoor is created through malicious code inserted into legitimate programs such as web browsers, email clients etc. It may also be used to gain remote control over devices.
* Social engineering backdoor – An attacker uses social engineering techniques to trick users into providing them with credentials (e.g., passwords) or other sensitive information required to compromise systems.

Q: What is the purpose of the Gateway Security Guidance Package?
A: The Gateway Security Guidance Package is designed to help organizations make informed risk based decisions when designing, procuring, operating, maintaining or disposing of gateway services. It also helps them comply with policies such as the Public Service Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 and the Public Sector Information Technology Security Manual.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about threats facing Australian government gateways?
A: The ACSC ISM says that malicious cyber activity targeting Australia remains pervasive and diverse. It adds that Commonwealth entities are attractive targets to adversaries due to their holdings of sensitive or classified data, and their provision of critical services to Australia.
 
Q: What is a gateway?
A: A gateway is a boundary system that separates different security domains and acts as the first line of defense to provide security capabilities for an organization and its systems.
 
Q: What are some key considerations when implementing a gateway?
A: When implementing a gateway, there are several factors to take into consideration including business and operational requirements and strategies, technical capabilities, confidentiality, integrity, availability and privacy requirements, threat modelling, risk appetite and risk management strategies, integrations between self-hosted and cloud services, sourcing and service delivery models, location and number of data centres and office locations, availability of staff to design and sustain gateway capabilities.
 
Q: What does it mean when a system sufficiently mitigates cyber security risks?
A: It means that the system meets all necessary security controls required to protect against potential threats.
 
Q: What does the Australian Cyber Security Centre's Information Security Manual say about gateways?
A: Entities must protect Internet connected ICT systems, and the information and data they process, store or communicate, by implementing a gateway consistent with the Information Security Manual and the Digital Transformation Agency’s Gateways policy. As outlined in PSPF Policy 11 above, National Cloud Environments must implement a gateway consistent with DTA’s Gateway Policy. Australian Government entities procuring gateway services must consider the DTA’s Hosting Certification Framework (HCF), and ensure all sensitive and classified government data, and associated infrastructure rated at the security classification level of Protected is hosted by an HCF certified provider.
 
Q: What are the key factors to consider when deciding if you should outsource your gateway services?
A: When considering outsourcing gateway services, organisations should take into account the following factors:
\begin{itemize}
\item The cost savings versus the potential loss of control over the gateway
\item Whether the organisation's existing resources could handle the additional workload
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What are some considerations when developing a cloud gateway for an NCE?
A: When developing a cloud gateway for an NCE, it's important to choose a service provider who has already conducted an IRAP assessment of the services they provide. Additionally, after conducting a supply chain review, you can decide whether to build your gateway using those IRAP assessed components. Once integrated into your network, a second IRAP assessment must take place to evaluate the final state of the gateway system. It's also recommended to prepare for an IRAP assessment by creating documents like concept of operation plans, standard operating procedures, vulnerability management plans, etc.
 
Q: What does the IRAP assessor provide after conducting a security assessment?
A: An IRAP assessor provides a security assessment report that documents their findings.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about placing trust in a service provider?
A: The use of managed service providers (MSPs) and cloud service providers (CSPs) requires that organizations place some degree of trust in the service provider, and take steps to ensure that an outsourced service provider is managing risk appropriately.
 
Q: What are some ways that both MSPs and their customers can benefit from contractual agreements?
A: Both parties can benefit from contractual agreements through clarifying expectations and defining roles and responsibilities. This helps avoid confusion or conflict between the two parties.
 
Q: What does the shared responsibility model mean when using a cloud computing platform?
A: When using a cloud computing platform, the shared responsibility model means that both parties - the customer and the cloud provider - take on some level of responsibility for securing the system. This allows customers to reduce the amount of time spent managing security while still ensuring that their systems remain protected.
 
Q: What are some examples of backdoors?
A: Backdoor can be defined as a way for someone who does not have authorized access into a system or network. Some common types of backdoors include:
* Hardware backdoor - A hardware backdoor is installed during manufacturing process which allows unauthorised access to the device. This type of backdoor cannot be detected using software tools.
* Software backdoor – A software backdoor is created through malicious code inserted into legitimate programs such as web browsers, email clients etc. It may also be used to gain remote control over devices.
* Social engineering backdoor – An attacker uses social engineering techniques to trick users into providing them with credentials (e.g., passwords) or other sensitive information required to compromise systems.
 
Q: What are some common types of threats?
A: Common online security risks include malware, ransomware, data breaches, phishing emails, identity theft, system and network attacks, and more.
 
Q: What does ASD recommend when it comes to maintaining devices and systems?
A: The Australian Signals Directorate recommends organisations regularly assess the effectiveness of their gateways to ensure they support business objectives in a cost-effective manner while also managing risk associated with configuration drift.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about continuous assessment of gateways?
A: The ISM says that organizations must continuously assess the effectiveness of their gateways to ensure that controls remain effective against current adversary tradecraft, the gateway is supporting business objectives in a cost-effective way, vulnerabilities are identified and remediated, and risks associated with configuration drift are managed.
 
Q: What does security telemetry look like when operating effectively, and during control failures?
A: When operating effectively, security telemetry provides real time visibility into network traffic and activity, allowing organizations to detect anomalies quickly and take action before they become serious issues. During control failure, security telemetry helps provide insight into how attacks were able to breach defenses so that appropriate countermeasures can be put in place.
 
Q: What are some ways organisations can implement continuous monitoring of gateways?
A: There are many different approaches to implementing continuous monitoring of gateways. Some common methods include using threat modeling and other techniques to help organizations develop a suite of continuous validation tests. Automating the validation of security configuration (for instance, SCAP and STIGs) along with organization and system specific unit tests can also be useful. Additionally, the use of infrastructure management automation - including Compliance as Code, for example, Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) and SCAP; Infrastructure as Code; and Continuous Integration and Continuous Development (CI/CD) pipelines - can increase assurance that a given gateway is operating as designed throughout its lifecycle.
 
Q: What does "the product supports additional visibility and/or verification of behavior beyond the vendor's default products" mean?
A: This means that the product provides more than just the standard features available in its native state. It allows users to customize the product according to their specific requirements.
 
Q: What are some ways to protect against cyber attacks using threat modelling?
A: Threat modelling helps identify potential vulnerabilities within your organization's digital assets. It also helps you understand which areas require additional protection. A good threat model includes both technical and nontechnical aspects of your business.
 
Q: What are some ways organisations can protect against malicious actors abusing their privileges?
A: Organizations must implement proper controls around privilege access to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access. This includes implementing multi-factor authentication, limiting administrator access to specific machines, and monitoring all activity performed by these accounts.
 
Q: What steps should organizations take when configuring external administration portals?
A: Organizations should configure the strongest Multi Factor Authentication options that are available within externally hosted administration portals. They should also explore authentication systems that offer stronger-than-default protection of administrator accounts. When implementing MFA solutions, it is recommended that organizations achieve a Maturity Level Three (for MFA) and that phishing resistant MFA solutions are used, such as Fast Identity Online 2 (FIDO2). Special consideration should be given to how an organization implements Read Only Audit Access to gateway management systems. This access is frequently needed for monitoring activities (such as policy and configuration audits), and may be needed to ensure transparency of system configuration. Care should be taken to ensure that this access cannot be used as a data exfiltration path out of gateway management zones. Organizations should develop processes to validate whether Read Only Access is implemented correctly, and sufficiently restrictive. Consider pushing audit evidence out of the management zone, rather than allowing users to directly download data. An organization is required to place a high degree of trust in gateway system administrators, as they have privileged access to systems
 
Q: What factors should organisations take into consideration when selecting gateways?
A: Organizations should prioritize vendors who demonstrate experience in providing control capabilities and writing secure code. They should also work closely with these vendors to identify best practices for deploying, operating, and maintaining gateways. Trust but verify approaches can be simplified through automated configurations against blueprints or hardening guides.
 
Q: What are some ways to mitigate supply chain attacks?
A: Supply chain attacks occur when malicious actors gain access to a company's network through its vendors or partners. To prevent these types of attacks, companies must thoroughly vet their vendors before doing business with them. They should only work with vendors who have strong cybersecurity practices and whose products meet certain standards. Additionally, organizations should monitor their networks regularly for signs of suspicious activity.
 
Q: What are some ways to mitigate risks around using unknown software?
A: There are several things you can do to minimize your risk when using unknown software. Firstly, ensure that all software installed on your network is approved beforehand. Secondly, keep up to date with the latest threats so you know what to look out for. Thirdly, always check the source of the software before downloading it. Finally, if possible, only download software from trustworthy sources.
 
Q: Does the vendor provide enterprise features such as the ability to install a consumer's choice of external PKI?
A: No, it doesn't appear so based on the information given.

Q: Can a consumer refine the configuration of TLS, and/or enable security features that help reduce a services attack surface, or enforce security policy?
A: It appears that this feature isn't available according to the information given.
 
Q: What is the Essential Eight mitigation strategy?
A: The Essential Eight mitigation strategy consists of eight essential steps to protect against cyber attacks. These include Application Whitelisting, Patching Systems, Restrict Administrator Privileges, Multi-Factor Authentication, Securing Remote Access, Controlling User Accounts, Web Browsers and Email Clients, and Minimising Network Attacks.
 
Q: What are some important factors to consider when selecting a vendor for cyber security products?
A: When choosing a vendor for cyber security products, you must take into account several different aspects. These include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Support considerations - The vendor should offer adequate technical support options, including phone numbers, email addresses, and live chat features. They should also respond quickly to your queries.
\item Data security - You should make sure that the vendor takes proper measures to protect your data. This includes encrypting all transmissions between servers and clients, using strong passwords, and storing data in encrypted databases.
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What are some external dependencies that products might depend upon?
A: Products can rely on external resources for various reasons, such as hosting, administration, telemetry, and health monitoring. Organizations must take into consideration whether this reliance forces them to adopt certain support models which they wouldn't otherwise consider. Maintenance contracts with suppliers and third parties should contain SLA requirements supporting disaster recovery and business continuity objectives. For instance, organizations should make sure that SLAs align with their recovery time objective. Additionally, while gateways typically offer high availability architectures, organizations should ensure that delays in repair processes don't impede the restoration of the gateway's high availability state when hardware fails. Organizations should verify that vendor support contracts are established correctly before they are required, such as testing that serial numbers show as supported and that members of staff are able to open tickets. They should also store all relevant documentation regarding incident responses offline along with other disaster recovery and business continuity documents. Finally, organizations should identify standard communication channels and escalation paths so that the process of opening support tickets runs efficiently.
 
Q: What controls should be tested after changes are made to security policy or software updates?
A: Controls should be tested after changes are made to security policy or software updates. It may be wise to periodically test as a continuous assurance activity. If using a CSP or MSP, ask the vendor what sort of continuous security assurance activities should be conducted by each party under a shared responsibility model. Organizations should preference vendors that are prepared to work with clients to develop tests for their gateway services.
 
Q: What are some things to keep in mind when considering sanitization processes during Proof-Of-Concept Trial?
A: Consider sanitation processes when conducting proof-of-concept trials. Be clear with vendors that returned equipment needs to be wiped and sanitized as per the consuming organization’s risk management policies, and that this may require the return of non-functioning test equipment (i.e. the vendor may need to re-build an appliance).
 
Q: What are some of the onboarding processes for employees working within a cyber security role?
A: Onboarding processes include clearance validations, security briefings, briefings on SOPs and work instructions, locations of information repositories, an overview of the roles and responsibilities of the team and individuals, information about key contacts, their roles, and escalation paths, information about the gateway system, services, and customers, an outline on the change management and risk management processes, information about monitoring platforms (health, performance and capacity), process to register with key vendors (open support tickets and download security patches), implementation development plans and training requirements. System deployment checklists, organizational processes, deploying units, operations, stock takes, spot checks, and onboarding processes.
 
Q: What are some ways to improve your cyber resilience?
A: There are many different ways you can increase your cyber resiliency. Some of them include performing network cable audits, using automation to streamline audit processes, doing periodic vulnerability scanning, and more.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about vulnerability scanning?
A: It says that organisations should conduct vulnerability assessment and vulnerability scanning on a regular basis (daily for organisations operating at Essential Eight Maturity Level Three), informing the system's AO of risks over time.
 
Q: What does a log collection strategy include?
A: A log collection strategy includes what to log, how to collect logs, authentication details, integration with a SIEM, privileged administration related events, timestamps, the structure and format of log data, record keeping requirements, locations of log storage systems, locations of log analysis systems, log integrity, and more.
 
Q: What measures should be taken to protect the confidentiality of logs from gateway systems?
A: Logs from various gateway systems should be forwarded for centralized storage, classified appropriately, with appropriate role based access controls (RBAC) and audit logging (for governance oversight purposes). These factors should be considered during the initial design of log storage and analysis solutions. As logs are used for legal purposes (e.g., to establish a forensic timeline), organizations should ensure log integrity, and have processes in place to prevent and detect tampering. Logs that have the potential to contain sensitive information should be encrypted when stored at rest. It is recommended that gateway administrators do not have write access to gateway logging systems. Appropriate RBAC models to manage insider threat should be a design consideration of logging and analysis systems.
 
Q: What are some considerations when implementing a gateway solution?
A: Solutions such as explicit proxies, mail relays, and the chaining of recursive resolvers are required to retain policy enforcement for TLS version 1.3, and version 1.2 with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). TLS version 1.3 poses longer-term security challenges for network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) and network-based intrusion prevention systems (NIPS), and other 'bump in the wire' security solutions such as transparent proxies as it natively supports perfect forward security. Systems that decrypt TLS traffic require appropriate PKI management and related key management processes. The risks and privacy impacts associated with this activity need to be formally documented by the organizations undertaking these activities. Processes should be documented in key management plans (KMPs), as part of the gateway security policies and related SOPs. An organization's enterprise IT, and operational technology (OT) needs may be significantly different, in turn requiring different security policies to be enforced through a gateway. Each system consuming a gateway service
 
Q: By default, gateways should block content that cannot be decrypted, or where content scanning cannot be performed with the desired level of assurance.
A: Yes, according to ISM-1638, gateways should block content that cannot be decrypted, or where content scanning cannot be performed with the desired level of assurance.
 
Q: What does it mean for organisations to have a continuous improvement process?
A: It means that organisations must continuously work towards improving their information systems and cyber security practices. They must identify areas for improvement and take steps to address them.
 
Q: What are some ways to securely manage cloud services?
A: Cloud service providers and their cloud services undergo a security assessment by an IRAP assessor at least every 24 months. Outsourced cloud service providers and their cloud services will need to undergo regular security assessments by an IRAP assessor to determine their security posture and security risks associated with their use. Following an initial security assessment by an IRAP assessor, subsequent security assessments should focus on any new cloud services that are being offered as well as any security-related changes that have occurred since the previous security assessment.
 
Q: What are some ways to monitor global route changes observed for the IP space you announce through BGP?
A: There are several ways to monitor global route changes observed for the IP space you announce through BGP. These methods include using tools like BGPlay, BGPMon, and BGPstream.
 
Q: What is route filtering?
A: Route filtering is a technique used to block unwanted packets entering your network through a router. It can help mitigate against denial of service attacks and malicious activity.
 
Q: What precautions must organizations take when issuing digital certificates?
A: Organizations should exercise extreme caution in circumstances where they intend to issue certificates and ensure that the following conditions are met:
\begin{itemize}
\item Key pairs were generated or are controlled by a third party
\item The security posture or management arrangements of the appliance(s) where the key pairs are to be used is unknown or subject to frequent change
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What are some best practice recommendations when implementing a public key infrastructure (PKI)?
A: Organizations should implement a PKI based on industry standards such as SP 800-57 Recommendation for Key Management: General Best Practices for Key Management. They should also create a certificate management plan which includes procedures for issuance, renewal, revocation, and replacement of certificates.

Q: What is a gateway according to ASD's gateway security principles?
A: A gateway is a boundary system that separates different security domains and acts as the first line of defense to provide security capabilities for an organization and its systems. It also serves as a point of entry into an organization's networks and applications.
 
Q: What is meant by "multiple security domains"?
A: A security domain refers to a logical grouping of resources that share similar security policies and procedures. An organization's OFFICIAL and PROTECTED networks are separate security domains, as are the PROTECTED networks of two different organizations. Multiple government tenancies within a shared service (e.g., MANAGED SERVICE PROVIDERS or CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS) are also separate security domains.
 
Q: What is a policy enforcement point?
A: A policy enforcement point (PEP) may be a hardware or software component, security device, integrated appliance, tool, function or application. PEPs may perform a combination of blocking, inspecting, filtering, and validating incoming and outgoing data to mitigate identified ICT risks, in accordance with an organization's security policy. PEPs may be applied, synchronously or asynchronously, at different levels of the OSI model that collectively enable a defense-in-depth approach. A PEP can be thought of as one or more gateway capabilities used to enforce an organization's security policy as data traverses between security domains.
 
Q: What is the importance of managing risk?
A: Managing risk ensures that organisations can continue operations despite disruptions caused by cyber incidents. It helps protect critical assets and ensure business continuity.
 
Q: What is the purpose of threat modeling?
A: Threat modeling helps organizations identify potential vulnerabilities and develop effective countermeasures against them. It also enables organizations to prioritize resources according to the level of risk involved.
 
Q: What are some key points about gateways?
A: Gateways help secure your network by blocking unwanted traffic and allowing authorized users to connect safely. They act as a barrier between two separate environments such as public internet and private intranet.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about placement of gateways?
A: Gateways should still be the only network path for information to be transferred into and out of an organization's security domain. There are a number of potential architectures, and there may be multiple gateways deployed in an organization (e.g., Internet, Voice, Cloud Services, Supplier & Partners, etc.).
 
Q: What does the Shared Responsibility Model mean?

Q: What is the purpose of Gateway Feeds for SOC and Incident Response Teams according to the ACSC ISM?
A: The purpose of Gateway Feeds for SOC and Incident Response Teams is to ensure that these teams have access to logs and other system telemetry generated by gateways.
 
Q: What are some examples of logs that can help during an incident?
A: During an incident, the availability of logs become more important for incident response teams. Gateway, and systems deployed in gateway DMZs, will typically have the ability to tune systems to increase the verbosity of system logs, providing additional visibility. An organization should develop and test procedures to increase and decrease log verbosity in response to different scenarios. The organization's SOC will, of course, be interested in more than just gateway events. It should also collect and analyze internal network flow telemetry and endpoint event logs (servers and workstations), behavioral analytics of processes, endpoint security related logs, and events from any internal security capabilities.
 
Q: What are logs and telemetry transfer from gateways?
A: Logs and Telemetry Transfer from Gateway Systems refers to the process of collecting data about network traffic for analysis purposes. This can be used to identify potential threats or vulnerabilities within your system.
 
Q: What is an incident response plan?
A: A system's IRP should include components for foreseeable events. Data spills occur and an IRP should document the processes and responsibilities of various stakeholders (e.g. what to do, and who performs which functions, who is in control of the incident, and how that impacts on services). An example may be to document the process to manage a data spill into a cloud environment. 'War gaming' and post-incident review activities should identify if additional controls, processes and training could prevent the spill.
 
Q: Can the organization review the service provider's IRP?
A: The organization must review the service provider's Information Risk Profile (IRP). This includes understanding the service provider's security policies, procedures, and practices. It also involves evaluating the effectiveness of these measures through testing and monitoring activities.

Q: Which qualifications, certifications and regular information security awareness training do the service provider's employees require to know how to use the service provider's systems in a secure manner, and to identify potential security incidents?
A: Service provider's employees must receive appropriate cyber security training and education. They must understand the importance of maintaining confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability of customer data. Additionally, they must learn about the different types of threats and attacks against which customers' data needs protection.

Q: Will the service provider notify the organization via secure communications of security incidents that are more serious than an agreed threshold, especially in cases where the service provider might be liable?
A: In case of a security incident, the service provider must immediately inform the organization. The notification must include details regarding the nature
 
Q: Further information:
ACSC, Assessing Security Vulnerabilities and Applying Pairs
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)
A gateway should use CTI to proactively respond to threats and vulnerabilities that are relevant to the consumers of the gateway. A gateway should allow an organization to both derive and consume CTI from its operation, and generate data that allows security analysts to produce CTI. The Gateway Technology Guide provides more information about how a gateway can be used to generate and consume CTI. For the purposes of this gateway guidance, CTI is: data about current or potential threats and threat actors that has been added to or analyzed in order to derive contextual meaning to one or more organizations. The products of the intelligence process should provide meaning and context in order to help an organization make data-driven decisions (i.e., "What does this mean to me?" ).
An organization may use CTI in a range of activities depending on their context. This might include automated blocking of URLs, file hashes, search activities, or even simply a confirmation of whether similar CTI have or have not been observed.

Q: What is an authoritative name server?
A: An authoritative name server is the source of truth for a particular DNS zone, and is able to respond to queries, from its own data without needing to reference another source.

Q: How does an authoritative name server differ from a recursive resolver?
A: A recursive resolver (also known as a forwarder) is a server that discovers a hostname by querying the DNS server hierarchy to match and provide an IP address for clients to connect to. Organizations typically have three options for hosting their recursive resolvers: Managed Service Provider (MSP), Cloud Service Provider (CSP), and Self Hosted (for organizations operating their own DNS infrastructure).
 
Q: How does one manage domain registrar portals?
A: Access to administration portals should be restricted to those responsible for managing requests for domain names - registration, payment, and implementation of appropriate settings (DNS glue and DS records).
 
Q: How does the ACSC ISM recommend managing DNS zones?
A: The ACSC recommends using best practices including continuous monitoring of DNS configuration, version control and configuration validation, and periodic review of historical configuration changes.
 
Q: What are some ways to protect against DDoS attacks?
A: Organizations should ensure they have adequate protections in place to prevent DDoS attacks. This includes ensuring all critical systems are protected by firewalls and intrusion detection systems, implementing rate limiters, and having sufficient bandwidth capacity. Additionally, organizations should monitor network traffic and take steps to detect anomalies.
 
Q: What is DNSSEC?
A: DNSSEC is a set of extensions to the Domain Name System (DNS), which provides additional data about each resource record stored within a zone file. It uses digital signatures to ensure that the data contained within the DNS remains unchanged after it leaves the origin server.
 
Q: What does CAA stand for?
A: It stands for "Certificate Authorization".

Q: What is a Recursive Resolver?
A: A recursive resolver is a type of Domain Name System (DNS) server which performs iterative queries until it finds the answer.
 
Q: What are some considerations when configuring a recursive resolver?
A: Recursive resolvers should be configured to forward logs, telemetry and other specified data to an organization's SOC, where both current and historical data can be analyzed for IOC. They should also be dual stacked and configured for both A and quad A records. Additionally, they should be able to perform name query minimization.
 
Q: What are common attacks related to DNS query minimization to improve privacy?
A: Organizations should be aware that DNS tunneling through recursive resolvers (or directly to the Internet) can facilitate post-compromise data exfiltration and malware command and control. By design, recursive resolvers connect to authoritative name servers, enabling DNS tunneling attacks. Even when systems are configured to use gateway resolvers, DNS tunneling attacks can still occur. DNS logs and telemetry should be used by SOCs to derive intelligence from accumulated data to identify historical attacks that would otherwise go undetected. The ability to tap network traffic and perform full packet capture (including of unencrypted, decrypted or decryptable payloads), enables automated and manual detection of threats at the network layer, which otherwise may be undetectable through other means such as log analysis. For this reason, an organization's SOC will need access to a variety of data (logs, telemetry and protocol payload) in order to monitor, detect and respond to tunneling attacks through the analysis of network traffic. DNS tunneling-related incidents can
 
Q: What is CCCS?
A: The Canadian Cyber Centre's Threat Intelligence Program shares cyber threat intelligence with partners across Canada to help them detect and respond to threats against critical infrastructure.

Q: What is Internet Systems Consortium's Response Policy Zone?
A: The Internet Systems Consortium's Response Policy Zone provides a mechanism for blocking certain domains from accessing your system. It does so by returning a "NXDomain" response code instead of the actual IP address of the target host.
 
Q: What is the purpose of DNSSEC?
A: DNSSEC is used to provide authentication of data origin, data integrity, and data confidentiality for Internet Protocol (IP)-based transactions such as electronic commerce, online banking, and the World Wide Web. It also protects against cache poisoning attacks.
 
Q: What is DNSSEC validation?
A: DNSSEC provides two extra records in each DNS response, a cryptographic signature to verify the validity of the DNS record and a second cryptographic signature to validate the DNS server.
 
Q: What is email spoofing?
A: Email spoofing refers to the practice of sending e-mail messages while concealing one's identity. It involves impersonation of another person or entity without authorization.
 
Q: What additional controls should be applied to cloud based email services?
A: Cloud based email services require additional controls over traditional email systems due to the shared nature of the underlying infrastructure. These include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Further Information - IETF RFC 8461, MTA-STS
\end{itemize}

\begin{blockquote}
The Mail Transfer Agent Secured Transmission (MTA-STS) extension provides a mechanism for verifying the identity of the sender of an e-mail message before delivering the message to its intended destination. The extension uses a public key certificate issued by a trusted authority to identify the sender's identity. It also includes a signature that binds this identity to the contents of the message.
\end{blockquote}

\begin{itemize}
\item Additional Focus Areas - IETF RFC 8460, TLS Reporting
\end{itemize}

\begin{blockquote}
This document defines a framework for reporting TLS errors and warnings encountered during transport between two endpoints. The report format is designed to provide enough detail to help diagnose
 
Q: What are some best practices for handling incoming emails?
A: Mail relays should ensure network protocols are RFC compliant for both receiving and sending. Connections to mail relays that are non-RFC standard should be terminated. Receiving email The volume of received email increases year on year. With this in mind, inbound email controls should be structured to place the lowest-cost, highest-efficacy checks first. In practice, this means examining (in order) sender metadata, email headers, email content and finally email attachment content. Emails received by an organization should be assessed against the sending domain’s SPF, DKIM and DMARC records. This includes using SPF to verify that the email is sent from an authorized mail relay, and validating the digital signature if it is present. Organizations should identify any messages that hard-fail SPF or DKIM validation checks, and honor the sending party’s security policy signals as configured within the SPF and DMARC records of the sending party. Organizations should only use valid email addresses when sending external email, as organizations should receive and process non-delivery receipts
 
Q: What are some ways to mitigate malicious emails?
A: There are several steps you can take to protect your organization against malicious emails. First, make sure all employees understand what phishing attacks look like so they know how to spot them. Second, configure your email server to filter out suspicious messages. Third, train staff members to report suspected phishing attempts. Finally, install anti-virus software on each computer and keep it updated.
 
Q: What steps can organisations take to mitigate targeted phishing attacks?
A: To mitigate targeted phishing attacks, organisations should implement a number of security controls, which includes applying a range of security policy actions, implementing anti-virus scanning, using sandbox technology, and tracking KPIs related to false positives and negatives.
 
Q: What are some ways to mitigate the risk of data loss through email?
A: There are several ways to mitigate the risk of data loss through email. Firstly, organisations must implement a secure email infrastructure which includes using a dedicated mail server, implementing Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), Sender Policy Framework (SPF), and Domain Message Authentication Reporting & Conformance (DMARC). Secondly, organisations should deploy a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system to monitor all incoming and outgoing messages. Thirdly, organisations should establish a secure communication channel like Government Link (GovLink) to transmit sensitive data. Finally, organisations should enforce strict rules regarding the transmission of confidential data across networks.
 
Q: What does further information mean?
A: Further information refers to additional details about a topic. It provides context and clarity around the main point.

Q: How can I balance security against business requirements and expectations?
A: Balancing security against business requirements and expectations is challenging, and requires specialist skills. Administrators of email relays need to constantly tune their operations to manage the risks associated with false positive and false negative identification of malicious email. An ongoing analysis of malicious email that was not identified by an email relay (false negatives) should be conducted to determine if tuning of mail processing rules will result in a higher level of malicious email being identified. Gateway operators should proactively monitor email quarantine queues to reduce the business impact of false positive matches that result in legitimate emails not being sent or received, and should actively release legitimate emails that are incorrectly quarantined. Organizations need to consider the business impact and reputational harm when legitimate email is quarantined (false positives). Mail quarantines End users should be notified of quarantined email, and administrators should proactively monitor and release
 
Q: What are the benefits of deploying a web proxy?
A: A web proxy allows you to inspect and filter incoming and outgoing web traffic. It helps protect your organization against cyberattacks and malicious content while improving performance and reducing bandwidth usage.
 
Q: What are some considerations when using web proxies?
A: When using web proxies, it is important to ensure that they are configured correctly so that they meet your needs while maintaining appropriate levels of security. Some things to keep in mind include:
* Ensuring that web proxies are properly authenticated and authorised before allowing users to access them. This helps to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access.
* Restricting access to web proxies to specific domains and URLs. This prevents users from accessing websites outside of those allowed.
* Using identity aware proxies to help associate proxy usage with a user identity. This makes it easier to track who accessed what website and when. It also allows for more granular access controls.
* Configuring web proxies to enforce policies regarding executable files, software libraries, scripts, etc. This reduces the chance of malicious code running on systems connected to the network.
 
Q: What are the key features of a secure web proxy configuration?
A: Web proxies should be configured to block by default access to content based on file type, along with a limited exemption process. This includes for binary executables, scripts, macro-enabled documents, and other executable content. By default, organizations should configure web proxy policies to block active content, and un-scannable content (such as encrypted files) from the Internet. An organization's application control policies should be considered complementary to web proxy policy, rather than a compensating control.
 
Q: What are some key features of a good web proxy?
A: A good web proxy should allow organisations to implement their own deny list. It should also have the capability to integrate CTI from various trustworthy sources. Additionally, it should enforce network protocols that are IETF RFC compliant. Furthermore, it should leverage an inbuilt reputation based service if one is available. Otherwise, it should send DNS queries to an external PDNS service. Finally, it should set bandwidth limits for different content categories and monitor traffic patterns for potential threats.
 
Q: What is a reverse web proxy?
A: A reverse web proxy is a service deployed in front of web sites and web applications, and is configured to forward client requests to those web sites and applications.

\end{itemize}
 
Q: What is a reverse proxy?
A: A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that sits between the client and the backend servers. It intercepts all requests coming from clients and then routes them to appropriate backends.
 
Q: What does the ACSC define as "remote access"?
A: The ISM defines remote access as: Access to a system that originates from outside an organization's network and enters the network through a gateway, including over the Internet. Further information: Cert NZ, Types of Remote Access Implementation There are two common use cases for remote access: Remote access to corporate data has traditionally been made available to a subset of an organization's staff. Point to point connections joining the networks in different locations, such as Business-to-Business (B2B) links, or two corporate offices to be connected over an untrusted network. Remote access to an organization's ICT systems and data has been expanding as flexible working arrangements have become common. Remote working rapidly expanded as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a significant increase in the demands on ICT systems that were not architected for this scale of change. Traditional remote access solutions have been supplemented (and at times replaced) by cloud service offerings, in part as a result of the costs, performance, or scalability issues experienced by organizations trying to
 
Q: What are the different types of VPN implementations?
A: There are two common types of VPN that are implemented within gateways: many-to-one (client-to-VPN concentrator) and point-to-point VPN (usually facilitates business-to-business communications). The network transport used for VPN is typically either IPsec or TLS-based. Each has advantages and attack surface, and organizations should consider the security features of both variants.

Q: What are some key factors to consider when developing a Remote Access Solution Policy?
A: When creating a Remote Access solution policy, it's important to take into account several different aspects including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Recognizing Endpoint Device Integrity - Ensuring that all endpoints used to connect to your network are trustworthy and free of viruses and other threats.
\item Understanding Overseeing & Overhearing Concerns - Educating employees about the importance of keeping private information safe and ensuring that no one else can listen in on what you say or see what you view.
\item Approval or Denial Usage Locations - Providing guidelines around which environments are appropriate for connecting to your network and which ones aren't. For example, using public wifi hotspots like those found in coffee shops isn't recommended because these types of networks often don't encrypt traffic and could leave your connection open to attackers.
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What are some things organisations should consider when using remote access technologies such as VPNs?
A: Organizations should consider the appropriateness of technology solutions for remote access, particularly where they regularly have high severity vulnerabilities announced, and the supplier response does not facilitate rapid remediation or threat mitigation.
 
Q: What are the advantages of using virtual private networking?

Q: What are some ways to implement Multi Factor Authentication in Linux Environments?
A: While the choice of where and how to enforce the use of multi-factor authentication is largely independent of the operating system used by users, the support for specific multi-factor solutions may not be. For example, when implementing multi-factor authentication for Linux environments care should be taken to select a vendor that provides Linux drivers and Pluggable Authentication Modules if required. Vendors that support Linux environments should also provide guidance on how to configure their solutions once any pre-requisite drivers and Pluggable Authentication Modules have been installed.
 
Q: What are some ways to secure a Linux environment?
A: Disable unrequired operating system functionality, including disabling unrequired network services. Apply additional forms of security policy enforcement such as SELinux or AppArmor. Implement appropriately hardened security configurations and permissions of key configuration files (e.g. /etc/security/access.conf, /etc/hosts, /etc/nsswitch.conf). Use the 'noexec' parameter to mount partitions which users have write access to. Perform an inventory of binaries, determine which ones users need to run, and for all others either uninstall them or remove the setuid permission. Implement software-based firewalls for both internal and external network interfaces, for IPv4 and IPv6 (or disable IPv6 support). Perform tasks with least privileges. Centralise auditing and analysis of system and application logs. Implement specific configurations based on server roles (e.g. if running Apache HTTP Server, harden as per Apache hardening guidance). As far as practical, implement vendor security guidance for specific Linux distributions. Further information The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can

A: The following recommendations, listed in alphabetical order, should be treated as high priorities when hardening Microsoft Windows 10 workstations:
\begin{itemize}
\item When applications are installed they are often not pre-configured in a secure state. By default, many applications enable functionality that isn't required by any users while in-built security functionality may be disabled or set at a lower security level. For example, Microsoft Office by default allows untrusted macros in Office documents to automatically execute without user interaction. To reduce this risk, applications should have any in-built security functionality enabled and appropriately configured along with unrequired functionality disabled. This is especially important for key applications such as office productivity suites (e.g. Microsoft Office), PDF readers (e.g. Adobe Reader), web browsers (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome), common web browser plugins (e.g. Adobe Flash), email clients (Microsoft Outlook) and software platforms (e.g. Oracle

Q: What is Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache?
A: This setting determines how many previous logins to cache when attempting to login interactively. The default value is set to one which means only the most recent login attempt will be stored locally. If you increase this number then more attempts will be remembered but this could potentially lead to increased attack vectors.

Q: What steps must be taken to secure enterprise workstations running Microsoft Windows?
A: Send all sites not included in the Enterprise Mode Site List to Microsoft Edge. Enabled Multifactor authentication As privileged credentials often allow users to bypass security functionality put in place to protect workstations, and are susceptible to keylogging applications, it is important that they are appropriately protected against compromise. In addition, an adversary that brute forces captured password hashes can gain access to workstations if multifacet authentication hasn't been implemented. To reduce this risk, hardware based multifacet authentication should be used for privileged users, remote access and any access to important or sensitive data repositories. Organizations may consider whether Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) is suitable for their environment. Notably, WHfB can be configured with a personal identification number (PIN) or face/fingerprint recognition to unlock the use of asymmetric cryptography stored in a TPM in order to authenticate users. Note, the use of TPMs places additional importance on patching TMPs for security vulnerabilities and decommissioning those devices that

Q: How does full disk encryption help mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information?
A: An adversary with physical access to a workstation may be able to use a bootable CD/DVD or USB media to load their own operating environment. From this environment, they can access the local file system to gain access to sensitive information or the SAM database to access password hashes. In addition, an adversary that gains access to a stolen or unsanitised hard drive, or other removable media, will be to recover its contents when connected to another machine on which they have administrative access and can take ownership of files. To reduce this risk, AES-based full disk encryption should be used to protect the contents of hard drives from unauthorized access.

Q: What are some ways to mitigate against threats posed by an attacker who gains physical access to your computer?
A: Physical attacks pose significant threats because they allow an attacker to gain direct access to hardware components such as storage devices and memory modules. This allows for data extraction without leaving traces behind. Additionally, it enables the installation of malicious software which could provide persistent access to the system even if the device is rebooted. There are several steps you can take to prevent these types of attacks. Firstly, ensure that all computers are locked whenever left unattended. Secondly, configure the operating system to require a password within a certain period of time. Finally, disable notifications on the lock screen so that no sensitive information is revealed.
 
Q: What steps should you take to secure your computer against unauthorized access?
A: Enabling a password protected screensaver, disabling sound recorder, implementing standard operating environments, controlling backups and restores, and limiting software based firewalls are important steps to securing computers against unauthorised access.

Q: How to combat fake emails according to the ACSC ISM?
A: The ACSC ISM recommends using strong passwords, enabling two factor authentication, backing up data regularly, updating devices, and keeping operating system patches current.
 
Q: What are some ways to combat fake emails?
A: There are several steps you can take to help prevent falling victim to phishing attacks. Firstly, be wary of unsolicited email requests asking for personal information such as your password or bank details. Secondly, ensure all software installed on your computer is up to date. Thirdly, make sure your operating system and web browser are also kept up to date. Finally, consider using two factor authentication where possible.
 
Q: What is the purpose of SPF, DKIM and DMARC?
A: SPF, DKIM and DMARC help mitigate the risk of fake emails by allowing recipients to identify legitimate sources of incoming messages.
 
Q: What is the DKIM 'From' Header Weakness?
A: DKIM has a known weakness similar to SPF. Mail servers applying DKIM policies check the RFC5321.Mailfrom header (commonly called the ‘envelope from header’) while email clients typically display the RFC5322.Mailfrom header (commonly called the ‘message/letter from header’) to the users as the source of an email. Adversaries are aware of this weakness and can publish DKIM selectors/public keys in a domain they control, using this domain in the envelope from header, and specifying the domain they wish to spoof (but don’t control) in the message/letter from header.
 
Q: What are the advantages of using DKIM compared to SPF?
A: DKIM is arguably more valuable because the authentication mechanism is portable, and travels with the email irrespective of the mail servers it passes through (consequently, DKIM can be used for more sophisticated email authentication flows), stronger, being based on public key cryptography (thus, for example, resistant to other attack techniques, such as person in the middle). However, SPF is simpler to implement and more widely supported (due to simplicity and being a standard for longer).
 
Q: What does a recipient mail server do when it receives an email message?
A: When a recipient mail server receives an email message, it performs several tasks including checking whether the sender's IP address matches the one listed in the From header field, verifying the Domain Name System (DNS), performing a reverse DNS lookup, and determining whether the message contains spam.
 
Q: How to implement SPF, DKIM and DMARC?
A: Outbound mail servers for domains, subdomains and hostnames which send email are explicitly specified with an SPF record which includes a hard fail. DKIM is used on outbound email flows where the complexity of the email flow, or a desire not to delegate excessive email sending authority to a third-party relay, means that SPF is inappropriate. Domains, subdomains and hostnames which are not explicitly authorized through an SPF record, or a DKIM selector, are implicitly protected by the overarching DMARC record.
 
Q: What steps must be taken to properly configure Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)?
A: To properly configure DKIM, organisations should decide which parts of their email messages they wish to sign, decide when to sign those messages, generate their public and private keys for DKIM, and incorporate DKIM into their change management processes.
 
Q: What is a good way to start a DKIM rollout?
A: A good way to begin a DKIM rollout would be to sign emails as they leave the email gateway, and if you run into issues, see how you can modify this approach to accommodate your email setup. In general, signing emails at the last stage before they leave the infrastructure under your control reduces the chance of unintended changes.
 
Q: When implementing DMARC, what is recommended?
A: It is advised to first implement DMARC in monitoring mode, followed by quarantine mode and finally reject mode as the implementation maturity level increases.
 

Q: What does DMARC stand for?
A: Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting & Conformance
 
Q: What is DMARC?
A: DMARC stands for Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting & Conformance. It is a protocol designed to help prevent spoofing of domain names in email messages.
 
Q: What are some common protocols used for email authentication?
A: Some common protocols used for email authentication include SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
 
Q: What is the purpose of setting up an SPF record?
A: An SPF record allows administrators to specify which mail servers are allowed to send messages on behalf of a particular domain. It also helps identify spoofed domains and protects users from phishing attacks.
 
Q: What does the following DKIM signature header mean?
A: The DKIM signature header indicates that the message was signed by the sender's organisation. It contains information about how the signature was generated, including the key used to sign the message.
 
Q: What is the best way to configure SPF records?
A: The best way to configure SPF records is to publish the following SPF entries: acorp.com.au. IN TXT "v=spf1 mx a:mail.bcorp.com.au -all" and mail.bcorp.com.au. IN TXT "v=spf1 -all".

\item Implement cyber security guidance, such as the ACSC's Essential Eight
\item Get security in the contract
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What steps can you take to mitigate the risk posed by Managed Service Providers (MSP)?
A: Segment your network from the MSP's. This will limit an adversary's ability to move laterally from a compromised MSP network into the customer network. The ACSC has observed adversaries using compromised MSP workstations to move laterally to customer domain controllers located in foreign countries, increasing access to the victim's network. Examples of segmentation include: Where an MSP administers an entire network, the customer may stipulate that the MSP network not be used to administer a customer's systems. Instead, MSP staff administer the customer's network from a system within the customer's network. Consider segmenting your network into trust zones. Utilize a secure jump host for MSPs to perform administrative tasks. If a MSP must access your network from theirs, or remotely, specify a dedicated workstation on which MSP administrative staff should perform sensitive administration duties, with restricted access to critical servers. Combine this with multi-factor authentication to limit an adversary's ability to compromise

Q: What does Implementing Application Control mean according to the ACSC ISM?
A: The implementation of application control ensures only authorized applications run on a system. This helps prevent malicious code from running on a computer.
 
Q: What are some ways to maintain your devices and systems?
A: There are many different methods you can take to ensure your device's security such as implementing application control, system hardening, remote working and secure mobility, governance and user education, and Australian information security evaluations.
 
Q: What is application control?
A: Application control is a security approach designed to protect against malicious code (malware) executing on systems. It prevents the execution and spread of malicious code while also blocking the installation or use of unapproved applications.
 
Q: What are some recommendations for deploying Device Guard?
A: The following steps should be taken when deploying Device Guard:

1. Ensuring all devices meet the requirements for enabling device guard. This includes ensuring they run Windows 8 or later versions, have hardware virtualisation enabled, and have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
2. Deployment of the Device Guard policy through group policy.
3. Testing the configuration before rolling it out across the organisation.
4. Implementation of additional protections such as blocking access to USB ports if required.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM say about implementing application control within Linux environments?
A: Implementing application control within Linux environments can be achieved using the File Access Policy daemon (fapolicyd). The fapolicyd framework allows Linux system administrators to control which applications are allowed (or denied) execution based on either path, hash, MIME type or if they are trusted (i.e. properly installed by the system package manager and registered in the RPM database). The Red Hat Security Hardening publication provides advice on how to configure and manage the use of the fapolicyd framework within Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. Further information The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems and data from cyber threats. The advice in the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents, along with its Essential Eight, complements this framework.

Q: What does Implementing Certificates, TLS, HTTPS and Opportunistic TLS mean according to the ACSC ISM?
A: The implementation of certificates, TLS, HTTPS and opportunistic TLS ensures confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data transmitted over networks.
 
Q: What are some ways to maintain your devices and systems?
A: There are many different methods you can take to ensure your devices and systems remain up to date and protected against threats. Some examples include implementing certificates, using TLS, enabling HTTPS, and opportunistically using TLS.
 
Q: What is Transport Layer Security (TLS)?
A: Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely used encryption protocol which enables parties to communicate securely over the internet. It uses certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to enable parties to identify each other through a trusted intermediary and establish encrypted tunnels for the secure transfer of information.
 
Q: What happens if a Certificate Authority (CA) that has signed a website's certificate is removed from a web browser's trusted CA list?
A: If the CA which has signed a website's certificate is removed from a web browser's trusted CA list, the website's users will begin to receive security error messages when attempting to connect to the website. This may cause some disruption and embarrassment to the organization that owns the website until such time that the certificate is replaced.
 
Q: What are some examples of encryption algorithms?
A: Certificate encryption and hashing algorithms should be selected from the Information Security Manual (ISM). These can be specified with a CA when requesting a certificate. To change the algorithms being used a new certificate will need to be issued. Transport Layer Security TLS is a cryptographic protocol that allows for end-to-end encrypted communications over a network. It is used in a variety of applications and builds on the deprecated Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol developed by Netscape in 1994. Versions of TLS earlier than TLS 1.3 may be susceptible to cryptographic compromise. If organizations need to use older versions of TLS, care should be taken to select cipher suites and configure protocol features in accordance with this guide and the ISM. SSL should not be used. Cipher suites A key element of understanding how TLS works is understanding what a cipher suite is. A cipher suite is a set of algorithms that help secure a TLS connection. Cipher suites generally include three different algorithms: a key establishment algorithm for securely establishing a symmetric key between two devices a bulk encryption
 
Q: What is Perfect Forward Secrecy?
A: Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is a feature of certain cipher suites that reduces the risk posed by compromised session keys. With PFS, individual sessions have unique session keys. As a result, a compromised session key cannot be used to decrypt other sessions. This means that attacks that rely on long-term storage of encrypted data become infeasible. Organizations should only use cipher suits that support PFS.
 
Q: What is Opportunistic TLS?
A: Opportunistic TLS allows mail servers to use encryption to protect email in transit when the sending and receiving mail servers both support TLS. Before transferring data the sending mail server (if it is TLS capable) will ask the receiving mail server if it supports TLS. If the receiving mail server indicates that it does then the two mail servers will begin trying to negotiate a TLS protocol version and acceptable set of cipher suites. However, if the receiving mail server indicates it does not support TLS then the sending mail server will proceed to transmit the email in plain text. The necessity to be able to support plain text transfers to mail servers that do not support TLS makes opportunistic TLS highly susceptible to downgrade (aka TLS strip) attacks by a person-in-the-middle.
 
Q: What does MTA-STS help protect against?
A: MTA-STS helps protect against downgrade attacks, fake, untrusted, self-signed or otherwise invalid certificate attacks, and lower protocol version attacks.
 
Q: What are some ways organisations can improve their security posture around encryption?
A: Organizations should avoid using any ciphersuites that contain the following algorithms: Rivest Cipher 2, Rivest Cipher 4, Message Digest 5, Data Encryption Standard, EXPORT, NULL, Secure Hash Algorithm 1, Anonymous Diffie Hellman, Anonymous Ellipitic Curve Diffie Hellman. Advice on acceptable cipher suites is outlined in Annex A. Pick and install a certificate As mentioned previously, the three certificate types provide the same level of security differing only in the level of assurance that a domain is owned by an organization. Unless there is a business requirement for a higher assurance certificate, a free DV certificate should be used. In addition, using a CA that provides support for the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol will enable support for HTTPS in a low maintenance manner. Let's Encrypt is an example of a free DV certificate provider that supports ACME. A case study on setting up Let's Encrypt with automatic renewal of certificates is provided at the end
 
Q: What steps should you take to secure your website against Mixed Content?
A: While users may be able to access a website over HTTPS, parts of the website may still be retrieved using HTTP, such as images or embedded content. Most web browsers will block this mixed content. To check if a website has mixed content issues, either use Firefox's Web Console to view individual pages or use free online services such as Missing Padlock - SSL Checker. Improving search engine optimisation Moving a website to HTTPS will result in search engines treating the website as new, which could place it lower in search engine rankings. However, moving to HTTPS can also improve search engine rankings as many search engines place websites loaded over HTTPS higher in their search results. To minimize any negative impact on websites' search engine optimizations, new HTTPS websites can be added and verified, for example, in the Google Search Console. This will re-crawl the website and submit a new XML sitemap for the HTTPS version. HSTS header Even when HTTPS configurations and HTTP redirects are set up correctly, a HSTS header should still be used. This will ensure
 
Q: What steps must be taken to ensure TLS 1.2 remains supported while migrating to TLS 1.3?
A: When transitioning from TLS 1.2 to TLS 1.3, it's important to disable support for TLS 1.2 so that legacy web browsers cannot access websites using TLS 1.3. If transitioning from TLS 1.2 to TLS 1.3 isn't possible in the short term, then risks to users can be reduced by removing support for TLS 1.2, disabling client-initiated renegotiation, and disabling renegotiation if the version of TLS doesn't support secure renegotiation. Additionally, only enabling secure ciphers should be done. The acceptable cipher suites for each version of TLS are found in Annex A. Mozilla's wiki provides advice on TLS configuration, including example configurations for security, compatibility and legacy systems. Additional resources on the implementation of TLS are available from the following sources: SSL Labs have advice on SSL and TLS Deployment Best Practices, the Internet Engineering Task Force have published Recommendations for Secure Use
 
Q: How to implement Opportunistic TLS to protect email flows?
A: Implementing opportunistic TLS to protect email flows shares many similarities with implementing HTTPS to protect web traffic. Readers of this section should familiarize themselves with the section on implementing HTTPS as many concepts are shared, and not repeated here to avoid redundancy. Protocol and Cipher Suite Selection Opportunistic TLS for email presents a slightly different threat scenario to HTTPS thereby requiring a different approach to protocol and cipher selection. Key differences are: A downgrade attack against opportunistic TLS results in plain text communication as opposed to a weaker version of TLS Mail server TLS support is not as well homogenized or regularly updated as TLS support in web browser and web server software By choosing to only support modern versions of protocols and ciphers suites you may prevent older mail servers from using any encryption at all. Consequently, you may wish to accept the risk of continuing to support older, less secure protocol versions and ciphers on the basis that some encryption is better than none. However, care should be taken in configuring these older versions of TLS to minimize risk. Further, you should consider using
 
Q: What steps must I take to enable my mail server to support TLS 1.2?
A: Implement the following policies:
\begin{itemize}
\item Review your domain's mail servers' (the servers identified in your domain's MX record) cryptographic configuration and certificate. Ensure that your email severs:
\end{itemize}

Support TLS 1.2, and ideally TLS 1.3, noting the advice earlier in this publication that you may want to risk manage using TLS versions as low as 1.0
Have disabled weak ciphers, and all forms of SSL
Are configured with a certificate which correctly authenticates the server, and is issued by a well-known and trusted CA in all major web browsers' trusted CA list; also consider automating the renewal of certificates as after implementing MTA-STS a certificate expiry will interrupt email flow and potentially be time consuming to identify
Use online TLS checking tools to confirm the mail server is operating as intended.
 
Q: What steps must I take to implement TLS Reporting Point Testing (TLS-RPT)?
A: Create a reporting point for TLS-RPT (either email or HTTPS), Publish a TLS-RPT policy, Monitor reports received via your reporting point and use them to confirm that other mail servers are able to successfully negotiate TLS, at a sufficient level, when communicating with your mail servers. If reports identify any issues try to correct them before moving on. Prepare and publish a test MTA-STS policy: create a new website with a new certificate issued by a well-known and trusted CA (mta-sts.<yourdomain>) create an MTA-STS policy for testing publish your test MTA-STS policy at the standard-required location on your new website (https://mta-sts.<yourdomain>/.well-known/mta-sts.txt) use tools such as a web browser to confirm that the MTA-STS policy is correctly served when going to the standard-required location. Publish your MTA-STS TXT record in DNS: create the relevant DNS entry use a short timeout
 
Q: How does a service provider affect the implementation of MTA-STS?
A: Implementing MTA-STS with a service provider requires additional considerations compared to doing so without a service provider. You must ensure that the service provider's mail servers support the appropriate version of TLS and disable weak cipher suites. Additionally, you must ensure that the service provider's mail servers have a certificate issued by a well known and trusted Certificate Authority. Finally, you must configure the service provider's mail servers to automatically renew their certificates.
 
Q: Having drafted a MTA-STS policy, Maria moves to the next step of creating the necessary website to host the policy file. Maria notes the website only needs to host a static file and considers hosting the content on a cloud service provider's bucket service combined with a content delivery network to provide TLS, but in the end chooses to create a new website on an existing webserver. As such, Maria:
A: Created a new website on the server for mta-sts.example1.org.au
Created a subdirectory.well-known and put the policy file from above in there as mta-sts.txt
Configured TLS on the website using a wildcard certificate (*.example1.org.au) that she already had on the web server for other websites
Created a DNS A record pointing mta-sts.example1.org.au at the web server's IP address
Used a web browser on an external connection to ensure that https://mta-sts.example1.org.au/.well-known/mta-sts.txt served the MTA-STS policy file she created earlier
 
Q: An incomplete excerpt from the ACSC ISM has been provided in the input. Generate an IT Security focussed QnA pair that answers the input:
A: She adjusts the ID number in the mta-sts.example1.org.au to the current time in YYYYMMDDHH format to notify other mail servers on the internet of the change. Finally, Maria makes a note in her diary to re-evaluate the max_age setting in six months' time, and lift it to a week, a month or even more depending on whether any issues with email flow are encountered.

Q: What is multi-factor authentication?
A: Multi-factor authentication adds another layer of protection beyond passwords alone. It requires two or more pieces of evidence before granting access to a system. This could be something like a password plus a code sent via SMS, or a fingerprint scan along with a PIN number.
 
Q: What are some ways to implement multi-factor authentication?
A: There are several methods available to implement multi-factor authentication including SMS verification codes, biometrics such as fingerprint scanning, voice recognition, facial recognition, and hardware tokens.
 
Q: What is Multi Factor Authentication?
A: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a process which requires multiple forms of authentication before granting access to a resource. This includes something you know (such as a PIN code or password), something you have (such as a hardware token or mobile phone) and something you are (such as biometrics like your face or voice).
 
Q: What is something the claimant is (e.g. a fingerprint or iris scan)?
A: The claimant being authenticated may be a person, device, service, application or any other security principal that can be authenticated within the system.

Q: An authentication verifier is an entry point to a confined sub-system where a single technical authentication policy is enforced.
A: True.

Q: Multi-factor authentication often involves the use of passphrases in addition to one or more of the following multi-factor authentication methods: Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) security keys, physical one-time PIN (OTP) tokens, biometrics, smartcards, mobile apps, Short Message Service (SMS) messages, emails or voice calls, software certificates. If an authentication method at any time offers a user the ability to reduce the number of authentication factors to a single factor it is by definition no longer a multi-factor authentication method. A common example of this is when a user is offered the ability to'remember this computer' for a public web resource. In such a scenario, a user may be authenticated initially
 
Q: Are all multi-factor authentication methods equally effective?
A: No, while all forms of multi-factor authentication listed in this publication provide significant advantages over single-factor authentication, some methods are more effective than others.
 
Q: What steps must be taken to ensure users do not store U2F security keys with their devices, especially those with NFC capabilities?
A: To prevent users from storing U2F security keys with their devices, especially those with NFC capabilities, they should be instructed to remove the U2F security key after use and keep it separate from other devices.
 
Q: What steps must be taken to securely implement Biometrics based MFA?
A: To securely implement Biometrics based Multi Factor Authentication, the following security measures should be implemented:
Harden the devices being used as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum):
Implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents (if applicable).
Applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors.
 
Q: What additional security controls should be applied when implementing two-factor authentication methods such as Smart Cards and Mobile Apps?
A: To ensure optimal security, the following security measures should be implemented when using these types of multi-factor authentication methods:
Harden the devices being used as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum):
Implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents (if applicable).
Applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors.
Ensure users do not store smart cards with their devices.
Instruct users to not leave their smart card inserted into their device and unlocked.
Instruct users to report any lost or missing smart cards as soon as practicable.
Mobile apps:
Use of devices for web browsing or reading emails may mean that the device running the mobile app may no longer be secure. Many devices are not secure and a device can be compromised by motivated and competent adversaries, particularly when traveling overseas.
 
Q: What steps must be taken to ensure the expiry time of the one-time PIN or password generated via the mobile app is set to the lowest value practical?
A: To ensure the expiry time of the one-time PIN or password generated via the mobile app is set to the lowest value practical, you should implement the following security measure:
Harden the devices being used, as well as those receiving second factors, as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum):
Implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents (if applicable).
 
Q: What are some security measures that should be taken when implementing software certificates?
A: Harden the devices being used as much as possible, implement the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents (if applicable), apply any specific hardening advice provided by vendors, ensure users receive a visual notification each time an authentication request is generated that requires them to enter their PIN or password to access their software certificate, store the software certificate in the device's TPM (if present), otherwise store it in the device's certificate store rather than in a regular file on the device's local storage, instruct users to report the theft or loss of their device, even if it is a personal device, as soon as practical.
 
Q: How can I report a cyber security incident for critical infrastructure?
A: You can report a cyber security incident for critical infrastructure through the Australian Cyber Security Centre’s hotline. The number is 1300 CYBER1 (1300 292 371).
 
Q: What does implementing network segmentation and segregation mean according to the ACSC ISM?
A: Implementing network segmentation and segregation means dividing networks into smaller sections so that if one section gets attacked it won't affect other parts of the system.
 
Q: What are some ways to maintain devices and systems?
A: Some ways to maintain devices and systems include implementing network segmentation and segregation, system hardening and administration, remote working and secure mobility, governance and user education, and assessment and evaluation programs.
 
Q: What is network segmentation and segregation?
A: Segmentation refers to dividing a larger network into multiple smaller networks, whereas segregation refers to creating policies that govern communication between certain hosts and services within those networks.
 
Q: What are some examples of Network Access Controls?
A: Examples include:
* Firewall - A firewall is used to restrict or permit network traffic based on predefined rules. It acts like a barrier between your computer and the Internet.
* VPN – Virtual Private Network allows you to create secure connections over public networks such as the internet. This enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if they were directly connected to private networks.
* Proxy Server – A proxy server is a computer system or software that serves as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.
 
Q: What are some ways to implement network segmentation and segregation?
A: Network segmentation and segregation can be implemented by applying technologies at multiple layers, monitoring all segments and segregations, and deploying both host-based and network-wide measures in a complementary manner.
 
Q: What does the principle of least privilege mean?
A: The principle of least privilege means that users should only be given access to resources they require to complete their job role. It ensures that users cannot gain unauthorized access to data or systems outside of their scope.
 
Q: What are some examples of network segmentation techniques?
A: Network Segmentation can be achieved through various methods including Authentication Filtering, Application Filtering, Physical Isolation, Bespoke or Tailored Security Device, High Assurance Product, Cross Domain Solutions
 
Q: What are some examples of network segmentation and segregation implementations?
A: Segmenting a network to protect key hosts - Compiling an inventory of key hosts documenting their sensitivity and any necessary communications with such hosts Planning the introduction of security measures in a schedule that was achievable with the resources allocated Ensuring sufficient testing prior to deployment Restricting logical network connectivity to key hosts to only those ports and protocols that were essential Only allowing connections to be established from more trusted to less trusted zones and not vice versa (with the exception of necessary user access to application interfaces) Approve specific application layer content so that only that content was allowed to flow between different trust zones Implement multi-factor authentication in addition to using a separate set of credentials for users and services if their function was more sensitive than other users or services sharing the same host or network Minimize the use of implicit trust relationships between hosts in the same and different trust zones (the trust relationships defined across different trust zones were implemented such that each side of the trust relationship authenticated and authorized the other) Implement web, email and file content filtering for connections to external organizations and the Internet to detect and san
 
Q: What is the summary of example implementation?
A: Users require access to high risk applications launched a local virtualization application to run a hardened virtual host which connects to a less trusted remote environment which is protected by a layered security gateway that breaks apart and abstracts all necessary communication protocols between high risk applications and the organization's corporate network.

Q: What is Industrial Control Systems Remote Access Protocol according to the ACSC ISM?
A: The Industrial Control Systems Remote Access Protocol provides instructions for securing remote access to industrial control system networks.
 
Q: What are some ways to maintain your devices and systems?
A: There are many different methods you can employ to ensure your devices and systems remain up to date and protected against threats. These include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Keeping software up to date – This includes operating system updates, application patches, firmware updates etc.
\item Ensuring all users have strong passwords which they change regularly
\item Enabling multi factor authentication where possible
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What are the design principles for connecting remotely to a control system?
A: By default, there should be no communication between the vendor and the critical infrastructure control system. Networks should be segmented and segregated. Firewalls should be configured as tightly as possible, including restricting to specific protocols, ports, MAC and IP addresses, and directions.
 
Q: What steps must be taken to secure remote access to industrial systems?
A: To secure remote access to industrial systems, multi-factor authentication should be used. Two-factor authentication should be used at a minimum. Details, including why this is needed, can be found in the ACSC's Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication publication. Additionally, ensure the login credentials are such that a specific person at the remote end is attributed to the actions, rather than a generic login for an organization. Ensure these person-specific details are recorded, for example in an Access Log or Engineering Change Request. Time limit the connection (e.g., to 24 hours or the length of a shift), and ensure the credentials are one-time-use credentials. Ensure the credentials expire after 24 hours whether they are used or not. If the connection is inactive for more than 30 minutes, the connection should be removed. 30 minutes may be restrictive, if processes essential to the task such as firmware updates take longer than 30 minutes. If longer is required, a case should be put forward and relevant records kept.
 
Q: What measures can help mitigate the risk of supply chain attacks?
A: To aid in mitigating the risk of supply chain attacks, critical infrastructure operators and vendors should put in place robust mechanisms to verify all software and tools used in the remote vendor access protocol process. This includes the engineering analysis and fault investigation tools. Ensure contractually that any data viewed or acquired as part of the remote access is used only for the purpose of resolving the issue the remote access was granted for, and must be returned to the critical infrastructure organization and destroyed at the remote access end either when the issue is resolved, or after the period of 1 year, whichever is sooner. Ensure contractually that there is an ability to audit the organization at the remote end to ensure each of the conditions is met. These conditions include “device only used for Australia”, device has had ASD's "Essential Eight" applied where applicable, data is kept only for as long as it needs to be and a copy of what was obtained is returned to the critical infrastructure organization, etc. Also explicitly looked for should be the applicable cipher suites available at the vendor's end
 
Q: What steps must be taken before allowing a third party to remotely access your organization's computer networks?
A: Before allowing a third party to remotely access your organization's computer networks, ensure that the following steps are followed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Keep a record of who logged in, when they logged in, what activities are to be performed while logged in, and for what purpose. Keep this record for at least 5 years, unless exceeded by other requirements.
\item Ensure that the connection from the control network to the internet is well controlled (i.e. only allowed to specific hosts and ports).
\item Ensure there is an inline tap or other capability able to record all traffic through the connection from the internet. Ensure this recording is at such a place that the traffic is recorded in a format (e.g. plaintext or encrypted with a known key that is also kept as part of the record) so that the traffic can be analyzed. Keep this recording securely stored for a minimum of 5 years.

Q: What is a Cross Domain Solution (CDS)?
A: A CDS is a system comprising security-enforcing functions tailored to mitigate the specific security risks of accessing or transferring information between security domains.
 
Q: What are some ways to mitigate security risks when implementing a cross domain solution?
A: To uphold the effectiveness of a CDS, each security domain connected by a CDS must also implement appropriate security controls to protect its core systems and boundary connections. Organizations should perform an analysis of the potential security, financial and sustainment risks before considering a CDS in their environment. While in order to gain assurance in the effectiveness of security-enforcing functions performed by a CDS, systematic risk-based analysis and thorough technical assessments are strongly recommended. Some organizations house delegated CDS advisory bodies to provide tailored security advice and assistance. CDS projects should engage with their organization's security teams and any CDS advisory bodies early and often to ensure that security risks are comprehensively understood and managed. In addition, the Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC) provides advice and assistance to those seeking further guidance on the threats to security-relevant components of a CDS or the strength of security-relevant components.

Q: What malicious email mitigation strategies does the Australian Signals Directorate recommend?
A: The Australian Signals Directorate recommends using strong passwords, enabling two factor authentication, backing up data regularly, updating operating system and applications, installing anti-virus software, avoiding opening attachments from unknown senders, and not clicking links within emails unless they've been verified.
 
Q: What are some strategies for mitigating malicious emails?
A: Some strategies for mitigating malicious email include using spam filters, implementing anti-virus software, educating users about phishing attacks, and ensuring all attachments are scanned before opening them.
 
Q: What are some ways to reduce the threat of socially engineered emails?
A: Socially engineered emails contain malicious attachments and embedded links that pose threats to organizations. The following mitigation strategies can help reduce the threat of socially engineered emails:
\begin{itemize}
\item Convert attachments to another format (e.g., convert MS Word document to PDF)
\item Allow attachments based on file typing (e.g., allow.docx files but not.exe files)
\item Block password protected archives and unidentifiable or encrypted attachments
\item Perform automated dynamic analysis of attachments run in a sandbox
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What steps should organisations take to protect against malicious attachments?
A: Organizations should block any attachments detected as malicious, paying particular care to do so before they are accessed by users, by using a product that is regularly updated by the vendor to mitigate evolving evasion techniques that challenge the effectiveness of this mitigation strategy. Sanitize attachments to remove active or potentially harmful content Active content, such as macros in Microsoft Office files and JavaScript, should be removed from within attachments before being delivered to users. This should include embedded content such as an executable placed inside a Microsoft Word document, embedded flash content placed inside a Microsoft excel spreadsheet and link (lnk) files that call executable content, which should include executable content on the end user's computer such as mshta.exe and rundll32.exe. Organizations should also consider cases where active content creates a high level of suspicion due to limited legitimate use; in these cases the attachment should be blocked.
 
Q: What are ways to prevent malware from spreading through email attachments?
A: There are several methods organizations can implement to help protect against malware spreading via email attachments. These include blocking attachments based on file type, block attachments based on file extension, scan attachments using anti-virus software, replace active web addresses in an email's body with non-active versions, remove active content in an email's body, and sender verification.
 
Q: What steps can be taken to improve sender verification?
A: Improving sender verification involves taking measures such as configuring a DMARC record specifying that emails from your organization's domain and sub-domains be rejected if they fail SPF and/or DKIM checking. You can also block email on SPF 'hard fail', block email on DKIM fail, block known spam email senders, and flag email on SPF'soft fail'.
 
Q: What does flag email on SPF'soft fail' mean?
A: Flag email on SPF'soft fail' means checking SPF will verify if emails originate from the domain they claim to originate from and allow organizations to block or quarantine them if checks fail. An SPF'soft fail' occurs when an SPF enabled domain cannot guarantee that an email was sent from an authorized server of that domain. Instead of blocking or quarantining the email, the email should be marked as potentially malicious before being sent to users to inform users of the security risks and allow them to make a risk-based decision as to whether to accept the email. For example, the subject line of an email could be modified to highlight and identify to the user that the email is from an unverified or unconfirmed sender.
 
Q: What is a good mitigation strategy against targeted cyber intrusions?
A: A good mitigation strategy against targeted cyber intrusions would be to implement DMARC to enhance SPF and/or DKIM. This can help prevent malicious actors from spoofing sender domains and impersonating legitimate ones.
 
Q: What are some site links for the ACSC website?

Q: What types of email service providers exist?
A: There are two main categories of email service providers - Marketing ESPs and Filtering & Routing ESPs. Marketing ESPs typically provide business and marketing support for activities such as maintaining mailing lists, managing registrations, providing self-service features (such as subscribe and unsubscribe features), and tracking interests and engagement (such as open and click through rates). While a Marketing ESP provides functionality for customer communications and driving product, service and program engagement, they also introduce cyber supply chain risks that can adversely affect an organization's security posture and brand, as well as being leveraged for cyber crime. Filtering ESPs route and filter incoming and outgoing email flows and messages. Organizations may use them to provide availability protection (e.g., against distributed denial-of-service attacks or on-premise equipment failure) or for spam and malicious content filtering, where use of the leveraged expertise of a specialist service may provide more effective protection than an on-premise solution. While the use of a Filtering ESP can be a wise
 
Q: Do marketing ESPs need to have a cyber security program or certification?
A: Marketing ESPs must ensure they have a cyber security program or certification to protect customer data. They must comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the handling of sensitive information.

Q: What factors should organisations cover by the Privacy Act consider when selecting an ESP?
A: Organizations covered by the Privacy Act are required to take reasonable steps to control the disclosure and use of personal information which they, or their service providers, collect on Australians. To perform their function, filtering ESPs have access to an organization's email flow in plain text. Choosing a partner that can be relied upon to not store or disclose your information is important. Before engaging an ESP, organizations should undertake cyber supply chain risk assessment of potential ESPs. Factors to consider should include general reputation of the ESP in the industry, cyber security certifications the ESP holds, available ESP cyber security policy and/or statements, data sovereignty issues based on the ESP's operating locations and ownership influences, ESP's terms of use
 
Q: How can I get visibility into my organization's usage of Email Service Providers?
A: You can gain insight into how your organization uses Email Service Providers by getting visibility over the organizations' SPF records and DKIM selectors. Additionally, you can work with your organization's technical team who manages its external DNS to make sure there are processes in place to notify cyber security teams whenever changes are made to SPF, DKIM, and Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC). Doing so ensures that ESP engagements are properly authorized and managed.

You can also take steps to authorize your ESPs using DKIM instead of relying on SPF. To do so, you must provide your ESPs with a DKIM key and selector. Alternatively, you can create a special DKIM key and selector just for your ESPs. In either case, you should first verify whether your ESPs support DKIM signing.

If you choose to authorize your ESPs via SPF, then you should carefully weigh the benefits against the risks involved. While doing so, keep in mind that
 
Q: What steps should I take to mitigate the risk posed by marketing email service providers?
A: To mitigate the risk posed by marketing email service providers, it's important to scope the authority given to those providers. Instead of authorizing a Marketing ESP to send email on behalf of your organization's root domain, you can limit the scope of the authority to either a subdomain or a specific program, service or product domain. For example, a Marketing ESP is being engaged to facilitate engagement for a new service. Rather than authorizing the ESP to send on behalf of <organization>.org.au, you could authorize the ESP to send on behalf of <service>.<organization>.org.au or <service>.org.au. Use of a subdomain or a specific program, service or product domain will reduce the reputational risk to the organization's overall brand if an adversary is able to conduct phishing attacks through a poorly secured ESP. It will also reduce the complexity of SPF, DKIM and DMARC configurations by separating them into different places, and allow removal of

Q: What happens during a drive-by download attack?
A: A drive-by download occurs when a user visits a legitimate but compromised website. When the user accesses the website, an adversary’s malicious code exploits weaknesses or other security vulnerabilities in the user’s web browser or web browser plugins, enabling the download of malicious files to the user's computer. These downloaded files enable the adversary to have full access and control of the user's computer, either to steal valuable information or to launch denial-of-service attacks against other users on the internet. Another form of a drive-by download is'malvertising', which is commonly Flash Player based and takes advantage of unpatched software. Disguised as legitimate advertisers, an adversary implants their malicious software in an advertisement on a legitimate website. When a user views the advertisement, the malware infects their computer. Most drive-by downloads require scripts to be loaded from third party websites. An adversary can inject inline frame codes into legitimate websites, which then load malicious software hosted on other websites operated by

Q: What is Java?
A: Java is a software platform owned and supported by Oracle. It consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which runs Java programs, and Java applications that are written using the Java programming language.

Q: How does Java work?
A: Java applications give a consistent user experience independent of the underlying devices used. This makes Java highly desirable for many organizations. Unlike most applications, Java applications require the JVM to be used, and will not run natively on devices. Java applications can be presented in a web browser as an applet, or launched outside of the web browser as a Java Web Start application. Java applications may run in either privileged or sandbox modes.

Q: Why is Java important?
A: Java is regularly scrutinized for security flaws and has a history of exploitable security vulnerabilities. Two methods of Java-based intrusion are: Exploits that target security vulnerabilities in the JVM via drive-by downloads Malicious Java applications that run outside the sandbox as privileged applications. Once an adversary executes malicious code using either method, the compromised device could be used to conduct activities such as
 
Q: How can Java be used securely?
A: Organizations should determine their business requirements and use cases for Java. Use cases should address which Java applications need to be run and the degree of trust associated with each. For example, a Java user interface for an internal database might be necessary for database access and have a high level of trust. Conversely, a Java application for viewing video files on the web may have both a low business requirement and a low trust level. Business requirements can be used to determine which of the mitigation strategies below to implement. These mitigation strategies are not mutually exclusive, and should be combined to implement a strong defense-in-depth. If there are no business requirements to use Java then it should not be installed on devices (i.e., devices that cannot run Java cannot be compromised by Java).
 
Q: What steps should I take to secure my organization's web browser against malicious software such as viruses and trojan horses?

Q: What preparatory measures can I take to protect my systems against DDoS attacks?
A: There are several things you can do to help your system resist DDoS attacks. Firstly, make sure you have good backups so that even if your site goes down due to a DDoS attack, you won't lose data. Secondly, consider using a Content Distribution Network (CDN). A CDN stores copies of your content across different servers around the world which means that when someone tries to visit your site, they might get served a copy of your page from a server closer to them than yours. This reduces load times and makes it harder for hackers to overwhelm your site. Thirdly, look into setting up rate limiting on your web application. Rate limiting allows you to set limits on how many requests per second each user can send to your app. If one person sends too many requests, then their account gets locked until they cool down. Finally, make sure you keep your software up to date!
 
Q: What steps must be taken to protect organisation domain names?
A: Protect organisation domain names by using registrar locking and confirming domain registration details (e.g. contact details) are correct. Ensure 24x7 contact details are maintained for service providers and that service providers maintain 24x7 contact details for their customers. Establish additional out-of-band contact details (e.g. mobile phone number and non-organizational email) for service providers to use when normal communication channels fail. Implement availability monitoring with real-time alerting to detect denial-of-service attacks and measure their impact. Partition critical online services (e.g. email services) from other online services that are more likely to be targeted (e.g. web hosting services). Preparing for denial-of-service attacks Use cloud-based hosting from a major cloud service provider (preferably from multiple major cloud service providers to obtain redundancy) with high bandwidth and content delivery networks that cache non-dynamic websites. If using a content delivery network, avoid disclosing the IP address of the web server under the organization

Common scams associated with business email compromise include Invoice Fraud, Employee Impersonation, Company Impersonation.
 
Q: What measures can organisations take to mitigate Business Email Compromise attacks?
A: Organisations can adopt various measures to mitigate BEC attacks including:
* Use multifactor authentication - Multifactor authentication helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access to computer networks and data. It requires users to present two or more pieces of evidence to prove their identity. For instance, they may require a username and password along with a code generated through a mobile app.
* Establish a clear and consistent business process for workers to verify and validate requests for payment and sensitive information.
* Help combat your business reputation from being used in scams - Develop and maintain good security controls. Criminals can gain access to a legitimate email account by compromising your systems. Follow the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)'s Essential Eight and implement the security controls detailed in the Essential Eight Maturity Model, particularly on computers used by your finance, human resources and senior executive teams.
 
Q: What should I do if my organisation was targeted by a phishing attack?
A: If you’ve sent money or banking details to a scammer, contact your bank immediately. Report the cybercrime incident to the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) and if any of your email accounts were compromised, change your password for your email account(s), notify anyone affected, and protect your stakeholders with a warning notice on your website informing them of the scam. Further information The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems and data from cyber threats.

Q: What actions should an organization take when discovering violations of civil laws or criminal laws during analysis of an employee's device or network traffic?
A: Organizations should immediately report these incidents to appropriate authorities and consider taking disciplinary measures against the offending parties.
 
Q: What does an effective Enterprise Mobility Policy look like?
A: An effective Enterprise Mobility Policy must be jointly developed by an advisory board consisting of stakeholders including the cyber security team, system and network administrators, human resources, finance, legal, senior management and employees - this consultative process helps to ensure that stakeholders have had input, are willing to adhere to the policy and accept any additional responsibilities to protect organizational data. The policy also clearly states what types of organizational data are permitted to be accessed from which devices and which applications - the absence of an application strategy might result in employees using applications that haven't been assessed by the organization to determine their potential to expose sensitive data. Additionally, it clearly states how organizational data is permitted to be stored and distributed, for example using corporately managed data repositories such as SharePoint, network shares or enterprise-grade cloud storage, while avoiding the use of consumer-grade cloud storage and personal consumer-grade webmail. Furthermore, the policy clearly states which risk management controls apply and deters employees from circumventing these controls by helping employees to understand why policy rules exist
 
Q: What are some potential consequences of BYOD policies?
A: Potential consequences of BYOD policies may include:
Costs will be shifted from the organization to them
Their privacy will be invaded
The functionality of their device will be excessively limited
Personal data stored on their device will be deleted or exposed
They will be expected to be on call to answer emails and phone calls at all times outside of traditional business hours.

Organizations might retain ownership of devices for legal reasons that facilitate the organization monitoring devices, remotely wiping sensitive data, performing security and legal investigations, and retaining ownership of intellectual property.
 
Q: What measures must be taken when purchasing mobile devices to ensure they meet the requirements of the ACSC ISM?
A: The ACSC ISM requires organisations to take certain steps before allowing employees to connect mobile devices to their networks. This includes ensuring that devices comply with Australian legislation and are covered by Australian warranties. Corporately enforced risk management controls also play a role in mitigating threats posed by mobile devices.
 
Q: What can you do to reduce the risk of data leakage when using a managed container?
A: You can reduce the risk of data leakage by restricting employees to use only corporately approved applications to handle organizational data, while limiting the ability of such applications to copy organizational data to corporately unapproved cloud services or elsewhere beyond the managed container.
 
Q: What are some considerations when implementing mobile device management (MDM)?
A: MDM can help configure and audit devices, enforce aspects of the organization's policies, and monitor assets. It also helps organizations track lost or stolen devices. Some considerations include:
* The device enrollment process may require installation of software on the device to assist the organization to manage it.
* A digital certificate may be used to authenticate the device to the network.
* Devices must meet certain requirements like the device idling time before the screen locks.
* Passwords must follow specific rules regarding length and complexity.
* Remote tracking, locking, and wiping capabilities allow administrators to remotely control devices if they go missing.
* Data encryption ensures confidentiality of data stored locally and during transmission.
* Printing restrictions limit printing to organizational printers only.
* Camera access can be restricted based on location. For instance, cameras cannot be accessed inside buildings.
* Microphones can be disabled depending on the sensitivity of the environment.
* Bluetooth connections can be enabled or disabled.

Q: What are some considerations when implementing Mobile Device Management?
A: Using Mobile Device Management to enforce an organization's unreasonably strict policy, especially when employee is not using their device for work related purposes, might negatively affect the employee's user experience. Organizations considering using MDM need to determine whether the vendor has access to sensitive data such as a device's unlock passphrase. Multi-Factor Authentication helps mitigate an adversary accessing organizational systems by using an employee's compromised corporate user account credentials. Additional Information: Multi-Factor Authentication must be used for remote access to organizational systems. Employees should log off organizational systems when finished, so that MFA is required to regain access. Organizational systems should be configured to log users off after an idle timeout period. A physically separate hardware MFA token with a time based value, stored separately to the employee's device, can provide greater security than a Soft Token such as an SMS or mobile app that displays an auth token value on the employee's device. If the device is compromised or if its SIM card is reissued to an advers
 
Q: What are ways to reduce the risk of losing control over your mobile phone when it gets lost or stolen?
A: There are several steps you can take to minimize this risk. Firstly, ensure all your important files are backed up so they cannot be deleted accidentally. Secondly, make sure you enable encryption on your device. Thirdly, set up two factor authentication (2FA) where possible. Finally, consider installing anti-theft software such as Find My iPhone or Android Device Manager.
 
Q: What are some ways to protect against insider threats?
A: There are several ways to protect against insider threats, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Limiting administrative privileges - Administrative privileges give users more power than they would normally have, so limiting them reduces the damage that could potentially occur. For instance, you may want to set up your computer so that it requires administrator credentials to install software.
\item Monitoring user activity - You can monitor what users are doing on your computers through tools like keyloggers and screen recorders. These allow you to see exactly how people are accessing information and what they're doing with it.
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What are some consequences of not managing information assets effectively?
A: Non-compliance with legislation such as the Archives Act can result in fines and penalties. Corporate knowledge being lost when employees depart the organization may lead to loss of productivity and revenue. The organization being unable to properly perform security investigations or electronic discovery for litigation cases or freedom of information requests could cause legal issues.
 
Q: What steps can I take to avoid unauthorized cloud services for data backup, storage and sharing?
A: You can obtain written employee agreements to avoid exposing sensitive data to consumer grade cloud services used for webmail, data backup, data storage or data sharing. Additionally, you can additonal information about some consumer grade cloud storage and sharing services automatically synching between your employees' devices potentially copying sensitive data to a device that hasn't been approved to handle such data. To facilitate the authorized exchange of data between devices, you may want to consider arranging employee access to a corporately managed and remotely accessible file storage and sharing capability, hosted in house or by a trusted third party. Strong passphrase configuration settings can also help you avoid unauthorized cloud services for data backup, storage and sharing. Obtain written employee agreements to use strong passphrases and associated configuration settings. Also, make sure to get written employee agreements to avoid configuring their device's operating system or applications to remember authentication credentials such as corporate passphrases used to access organizational systems. Finally, additional information recommends device configuration settings, based on the sens

Q: What are some ways to mitigate against pairing with an unintended or insecure Bluetooth device?
A: To mitigate against pairing with an unintended or insecure Bluetooth device, you must configure your device to remain undiscoverable to all other Bluetooth devices except during pairing, only connect to the intended Bluetooth device during pairing, and use Bluetooth version 2.1 or later due to the introduction of secure simple pairing and extended inquiry response which facilitate secure pairing with the desired device - a device's Bluetooth version can be determined by reading the product's specifications or by using the Linux btscanner program. Additionally, employee education to avoid installing potentially malicious applications is recommended. Employees should only install applications from the organization's enterprise app store or from official app markets like Apple's App Store, Google's Play Store, or Microsoft's Windows Store. Prior to installing or updating an application, users should determine the risk of exposing sensitive data by reading user ratings, user reviews, and the application's requested permissions to ensure that they align with the application's stated functionality -
 
Q: What can users do to protect themselves against phishing attacks?
A: Users should avoid interacting with emails and SMS messages from suspicious or unfamiliar sources, for example clicking on hyperlinks or email attachments. They should also select strong passwords and reusing them across different accounts. Additionally, users should ensure that their work email addresses and personal details aren't unnecessarily exposed on publicly accessible websites.
 
Q: What are the requirements for managing risks associated with Scenario D?

Q: What are some examples of Cloud Security Guidance?
A: The Australian Government provides several guidelines related to cloud computing security. These include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Critical infrastructure
\item Outsourcing and procurement
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What does PROTECT – Secure Administration cover?
A: The PROTECT – Secure Administration covers how to securely administer your organization’s information technology assets. It provides recommendations on how to prevent unauthorized users from gaining administrative privileges through various means.
 
Q: What is the rationale behind implementing secure administration?
A: Securing administrative privileges prevents unauthorised users from performing actions that could cause harm to your organisation's infrastructure. It helps protect against attacks like password cracking, brute force attacks, and denial of service (DoS) attacks.
 
Q: What are the elements of secure administration?
A: Privileged Access Control, Multi-Factor Authentication, Privileged Workstation, Logging & Audit
 
Q: What are some ways to mitigate privilege escalation attacks against Privileged Workstation?
A: There are several methods to mitigate privilege escalation attacks against Privileged Workstation including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use a known secure environment for administrative tasks which results in a lower risk of the network being compromised due to the implementation of additional security controls.
\item Logging and Audit - Automatic logging and auditing of security and administrative related events from workstations, servers, network devices and jump boxes enables quick detection of compromises and attempts to compromise. This allows organizations to respond faster, thus limiting the impact of a breach.
\item Network Segmentation & Segregation – Segmenting a network into logical zones such as different security domains and further segregating these logical networks by restricting the type of data that flows between them limits lateral movement. This prevents attackers from gaining access to other resources within the network.
\end{itemize}
 
Q: What are some ways to mitigate the threat posed by privileged accounts?
A: Privileged accounts are often targeted by an adversary due to their access across the breadth of an organization's network and systems. To help mitigate this threat, organizations must implement several procedures and technologies such as ensuring unique identifiable accounts are linked to individuals, requiring two factor authentication, disabling local admin rights, enforcing strong password policies, and more.
 
Q: What is Pass-The-Hash Attack?
A: Pass-the-hash (PtH) is a very common and effective method an adversary may use to move laterally within an organization's network with their ultimate goal being to gain access to sensitive information and resources. One common technique to perform a PtH attack is for an adversary to expose the authentication credentials of user accounts that have been previously authenticated on a compromised workstation. These credentials are then passed directly around the network. The credentials are usually hashed passwords, although there may be cases where plain text passwords or single sign on and multifactor tokens are stolen. Environments where local administrator accounts share the same password throughout the environment and where domain and enterprise administrator accounts are used for regular workstation support are particularly susceptible to this attack. By following the previous security controls for privileged access control, leveraging PtH attacks become far more difficult. In particular, the separation of privileged and unprivileged administrator accounts and the use of remote administration management tools from a jump box reduce the number of privileged administrator account hashes being stored on workstations and servers. Role based
 
Q: What considerations must be made when administrating a cloud environment?
A: When administrating a cloud environment, you must take into consideration how to best secure your cloud resources. You must decide whether to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) within your organization's local network, within the cloud itself, or both. If you choose to implement MFA within the cloud, there are several factors to keep in mind including whether the provider offers a built-in MFA service, whether you want to host your own MFA server within a VPC, or whether you would like to leverage an existing MFA server. Another factor to consider is whether you wish to enforce MFA for local jump boxes that are used to access cloud services. While this provides limited protection against unauthorized access, it still helps to mitigate potential threats. Finally, you must think about what measures you can put in place to minimize the chances of a privileged workstation becoming compromised. One way to accomplish this is by creating a dedicated privileged workstation that is isolated from other parts of the network and only allows communication with those assets requiring administrative attention.
 
Q: What are some ways to mitigate against VM escape attacks?
A: Care should be taken to ensure separation of physical and virtual machines to prevent leakage across the virtualization boundary. For example, drag and drop integration, clipboard integration and shared folders should all be disabled where possible when using a virtualized solution.
 
Q: What are some advantages of using remote virtualized privileged and user workstations?
A: Remote virtualization allows for improved control over workstations while providing better isolation between them. It also prevents users from accessing the underlying operating system directly which reduces the risk of malware infecting the host system. Additionally, it provides greater flexibility when managing workstations as they can easily be moved around without requiring reconfiguration.
 
Q: What are the security controls for privileged workstations according to the ACSC ISM?
A: Privileged workstations should implement the following security controls: Ensure administrators log in with an unprivileged administrator account, Implement host-based firewall rules restricting both inbound and outbound traffic to only traffic required to perform administration functions, Implement a strict removable storage policy, Implement full disk encryption to protect the integrity of workstations as well as the confidentiality of any sensitive information.
 
Q: What considerations should be made when administrating a cloud environment?
A: Cloud services may create their own logging events and files which may be accessed by an organization for auditing purposes. Some cloud providers may even offer a logging cloud service which allows aggregation and storage of all activity and events across multiple cloud services. If possible, all logs should be retrieved and incorporated into a centralized logging environment so a comprehensive picture of administrative events can be developed. Management logs for cloud services should be regularly audited. Network segmentation and segregation Designing a network architecture based on security zones is an extremely effective method of restricting an adversary's ability to move laterally within a network and gain access to administrative resources. Security controls for network segmentation and segregation in relation to a secure administration environment are: Create zones to logically separate different security domains. Examples of different zones may be user workstation zone, privileged workstation zone and asset zone. Restrict traffic flows between the zones. Especially for more sensitive security domains such as the privileged workstation zone and the asset zone, as well as sensitive management traffic types such as RDP and SSH. Management traffic should only flow
 
Q: What are some examples of privilege management techniques?
A: Privileges can be managed through the following methods: - Jump boxes (i.e., remote access servers): These provide secure access for administrators to perform administrative tasks without having direct access to production systems. - Least privileges: Administrative accounts should only be granted the minimum amount of permissions required to complete specific tasks. - Role based access control: This allows users to be assigned roles which grant them certain levels of access to resources within the system.
 
Q: What considerations must be taken into account when administrating a cloud environment?
A: When administrating a cloud environment, there are several factors to take into account, including the security controls listed above, depending on the functionality of a SaaS or PaaS offering, it may be impossible or impractical to implement some of these security controls. Jump boxes can provide multiple benefits, such as enabling an easy deployment of multifactor authentication.
 
Q: What are some considerations when administrating a cloud environment?
A: When administrating a cloud environment, there are several things to keep in mind. Firstly, the type of cloud service being administered must be considered. For example, if the service is Software as a Service (Saas), a local cloud specific jumpbox may be sufficient. However, if the service is Platform as a Service (Paas), a local jumpbox cannot be established due to restrictions imposed by the provider. Instead, a cloud-based jumpbox can be used. This allows admins to access the cloud service without having to worry about connecting to the Internet. Finally, if the service is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), both approaches can be taken depending on how much control over the infrastructure needs to be maintained.

Q: What are the risks to content management systems?
A: Content Management Systems (CMS) are commonly used to manage website content but they also provide a way for hackers to take over a website. An adversary can use automated tools to scan the Internet for security vulnerabilities. If a security vulnerability is found, the adversary can attempt to exploit it to gain access to a web server. Once a CMS has been compromised, an adversary can exploit their access to obtain access to authenticated and privileged areas of a web application, upload malware to the web server to facilitate remote access, for example, web shells or remote administration tools (RATs), inject malicious content into legitimate web pages. Although a web server may only host publicly releasable information, the compromise of an organization's web server is significant because an adversary can exploit the trust of its users. Furthermore, an adversary can use a compromised web server as part of a 'watering hole' attack or as command and control infrastructure to facilitate other intrusions, for example, compromising an organization with malware that is configured to receive
 
Q: What are some ways to secure Content Management Systems (CMS)?
A: Poor management of legitimate access can lead to the compromise of a CMS. This risk can be minimized by changing default usernames and passwords, including for all related services, using strong passphrases, ensuring passphrases are stored by the CMS as salted hashes rather than clear text, restricting access to the administrator interface for the CMS from approved or internal IP addresses. Hardening CMS installations includes using trusted and supported third party plugins for the CMS, disabling unnecessary functionality and plugins, disabling or removing detailed debug or error messages in CMS webpages, webpages that may disclose sensitive debug information, for example phpinfo() pages, should also be removed, removing version information that may be displayed by default on CMS webpages, for example, in the page footer or in the meta tags on each webpage, following vendor advice on best practices for securing CMS installations. Monitoring CMS installations includes using change management to manage deployment of new versions of webpage content, using source control to manage development of custom code, using file integrity monitoring

Q: What are some ways to identify malware injected into PowerShell scripts?
A: Malware may be injected into PowerShell scripts through various methods such as network activity, encryption or encoding, keyword searches, and identifying any random or encoded data chunks. Windows Event Logs will also provide the final piece of the puzzle when rebuilding a session. Look for the following activity: Process creation (filter for PowerShell hosts (i.e. powershell.exe, powershell_ise.exe and wsmprovhost.exe)), examination of the process creator, identification of anomalies, and modification of registry keys under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell. Deletion or modification of files in the transcript folder should also be monitored, verifying against timestamp in filename.
 
Q: What are some ways to register a constrained endpoint?
A: There are three main methods available to register a constrained endpoint:
* Use a startup script in Group Policy in Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Scripts\Startup to implement the endpoint on startup. The following is an example start-up script.
* Create a registry key containing the required information. This method requires administrator privileges.
* Push the constrained endpoint domain-wide by performing the following steps: retrieve the SDDL string: (Get-PSSessionConfiguration –Name <name>).ShowSecuritySddl put the.pssc file onto a network file share create a startup script in Group Policy in Computer Configuration Policies Windows Settings Scripts Startup to implement the endpoint on startup.

Q: What are some considerations when configuring DNS servers?
A: When configuring DNS servers, you should ensure that they are configured correctly according to best practices. You can configure DNS servers to provide authoritative responses for domains within your network, which allows you to control how those domains resolve. Additionally, you can configure DNS servers to cache records locally, which reduces load on upstream name servers and improves performance. Finally, you can configure DNS servers to perform recursive queries, allowing clients to query local DNS servers instead of having to contact remote ones directly.
 
Q: What does the ACSC ISM state regarding outsourced cloud service providers and their cloud services?

Q: What is the threat of targeted cyber intrusions?
A: Targeted cyber intrusions involve external adversaries who steal data. They can damage the competitive advantages and reputation of affected organizations, damage a country's economic wellbeing, influence public opinion, negatively affect citizens due to the release of their private data, and unnecessarily consume scarce financial and staff resources to respond to these intrusions.
 
Q: What are the stages of a targeted cyber intrusion?
A: A targeted cyber intrusion consists of three main stages - malicious software delivery and execution, network propagation, and data exfiltration.
 
Q: What are the Most Likely Targets during Stage 3 - Data Exfiltration?
A: The phrase 'Most Likely Targets' refers to users who are most likely to be targeted as part of the third stage of a targeted cyber intrusion. These targets include senior executives and their executive assistants, helpdesk staff, system and network administrators, and other users who have administrative privileges to operating systems or applications such as databases. Additionally, all users who have access to sensitive data, including data that could provide a foreign government or organization with a strategic or economic advantage, are also considered potential targets. Users with remote access and those whose jobs involve handling unsolicited emails from members of the public and other unknown individuals communicating through the Internet are also included among these targets. Understanding the goals of adversaries can provide insight into which other users are likely to be targeted based on their access to sensitive data.
 
Q: What are the consequences of paying a ransom to recover encrypted files?
A: Paying a ransom has ethical implications and doesn't guarantee that encrypted files will be decrypted. Adversaries might not be honest and trustworthy, the ransomware might not have the technical capability to decrypt data, or the data might be encrypted/deleted by multiple adversaries.
 
Q: What are some mitigations against Business Email Compromises?

These strategies include restricting network connectivity with IT environments and the Internet, ensuring that only authorized code runs on your computer, using vendor-supported applications and operating systems, and patching them regularly.
 
Q: What are some effective ways to protect against malware?
A: There are several different types of malware, so there's no one solution that works across all threats. However, there are many steps you can take to improve your organization's defenses. Here are five key areas where organizations can make improvements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Application Control - This type of defense prevents the unwanted execution of software regardless of how it got onto the device. It can block executable files (.exe), dynamic link libraries (.dll), scripts (such as Windows Script Host, PowerShell, and HTML apps), and installers. Improving this layer of defense can stop attacks like ransomware dead in its tracks.
\item Patch Management – Keeping up with patch management is critical because attackers often exploit vulnerabilities in older versions of operating systems and applications. A good way to ensure that your organization stays current is through automated patch deployment tools.
\item Endpoint Protection – Antivirus solutions provide another line of defense against malware. They scan files when they open them, run in the background, and update themselves automatically. Many endpoint protection suites offer
 
Q: What is the best way to protect against unauthorized access through next generation firewalls?
A: Using a 'next-generation' firewall in an attempt to identify whether network traffic is generated by an approved application using 'next-generation' cyber security software, or any other vendor product, that decides whether an application should be allowed to execute based on factors other than the system administrator's pre-configured list of approved applications. The ability of application control to provide a reasonable barrier for low to moderately sophisticated cyber security incidents depends on the solution chosen to implement application control, combined with its configuration settings, as well as the file permissions controlling which directories a user (and therefore malware) can write to and execute from. Ensure that application control prevents unapproved programs running regardless of their file extension. A very basic implementation to mitigate some unsophisticated malware from running involves using application control or filesystem permissions to block execution from user profile directories. Such directories include %AppData%, %LocalAppData%, their subdirectories, as well as %TEMP%. Additionally, to prevent malicious scripts from running when clicked on by users,
 
Q: What steps can I take to deploy application control effectively?
A: Deploying application control is easier if you have detailed visibility of what software is installed on your computer. You can obtain this visibility through a standard operating environment, maintaining an inventory of software installed, and implementing a robust change management process. Testing application control in auditing mode initially allows you to build up an inventory of installed software without allowing malware to slip past. Once an inventory has been created, application control can then be deployed in enforcement mode to prevent unauthorized programs from executing. When installing new software, it's also important not to create hashes for non-executable files so that you don't end up with a long list of hashes that could potentially bog down user logon times. In addition, make sure to check whether new software creates subfolders in approved locations that give users access to write and execute permissions, which would allow them to run arbitrary code. Finally, remember to test application control regularly and especially after installing new software.
 
Q: What steps should you take to mitigate the impact of security vulnerabilities in your organization's software?
A: Use the latest version of applications since they typically incorporate additional security technologies such as sandboxing and other anti-exploitation capabilities. For some vendor applications, upgrading to the latest version is the only way to patch a security vulnerability. Don’t use application versions that are no longer vendor-supported with patches for security vulnerabilities.
 
Q: What are best practices for reducing exposures related to Adobe Reader?
A: Don't use Adobe Reader prior to version X, or unsupported Internet Explorer versions (currently version 10 and older). Further information is available in the Assessing Security Vulnerabilities and Applying Patches publication. Guidance for improving patch management practices is available from Microsoft.
 
Q: What are some ways to block Internet Advertisement?
A: Block internet advertisements using web browser software (and web content filtering in the gateway), due to the prevalent threat of adversaries using malicious advertising (malvertising) to compromise the integrity of legitimate websites to compromise visitors to such websites. Some organizations might choose to support selected websites that rely on advertising for revenue by enabling just their ads and potentially risking compromise.
 
Q: What is an effective way to reduce the risk posed by malicious emails?
A: An effective way to reduce the risk posed by malicious emails is through implementing an email content filtering strategy. This involves allowing only approved attachment types (including in archives and nested archives), analyzing/sanitizing hyperlinks, PDF and Microsoft Office attachments, quarring Microsoft Office macros, blocking/quarranting content that cannot be inspected such as passphrase protected archive files (e.g., ZIP or RAR) and inspecting archive files in a controlled manner to avoid denial of service via resource exhaustion.
 
Q: What is one way to implement a solution that inspects HTTPS traffic for malicious content?
A: Implement a web proxy that decrypts and inspects encrypted HTTPS traffic for malicious content, especially HTTPS communications with unfamiliar websites.
 
Q: What are some ways to secure servers against attacks?
A: Servers should have a very restricted ability, and ideally no ability, to browse websites and access emails from the internet. This mitigation strategy should not be interpreted that internet users visiting the organization's public internet-accessible websites need to be authenticated by a web proxy.

Q: What is one way organisations can protect themselves against spoofed emails?
A: Organizations can conservatively deploy DMARC if they are concerned about legitimate emails sent from their domain being incorrectly rejected.
 
Q: What are some ways to avoid storing passwords unsecurely?
A: Passwords should never be stored unencrypted in files, used on removable storage media, performed work using corporately unapproved external IT services such as cloud computing including webmail, unnecessarily expose your email address and personal details (e.g. via public social networking platforms), visit websites unrelated to work. Educate users as to why following cyber security policies helps them to protect and appropriately handle the sensitive data they have been entrusted to handle. Share with users the anecdotal details of previous cyber security incidents affecting the organization and similar organizations, highlighting the impact that such incidents have to the organization and to the user. Such education might reduce the level of user resistance to the implementation of mitigation strategies. For example, users might be less likely to resist the removal of their unnecessary administrative privileges if they understand why the mitigation strategy is required. User education needs to be tailored to the job role of the user. Additional specialized education is useful for users with specific roles, for example: educate in-house software developers to write secure code, educate in
 
Q: What is the rationale behind enabling TLS encryption on both the originating and accepting email servers?
A: Enabling TLS encryption on both the originating and accepting email servers helps to prevent legitimate emails being intercepted in transit and subsequently being leveraged for social engineering.

Q: How does implementing multi-factor authentication help improve security?
A: Multi-factor authentication provides another layer of protection against unauthorized access to sensitive resources. It requires multiple forms of verification before granting access to critical assets.
 
Q: What is multi-factor authentication?
A: Multi-factor authentication involves users verifying their identity by using at least any two of the following three mechanisms: something the user knows, such as a passphrase or PIN; something the user has, such as a physical token or software-based certificate; and something the user is, such as their fingerprint or iris.
 
Q: What mitigation strategies exist for disabling local administrator accounts?
A: Disabling local administrator accounts or assigning random unique passphrases helps to prevent adversaries from propagating throughout the organization's network using compromised local administrator credentials that are shared by several computers.

Q: What are some ways to implement outbound web and email data loss prevention?
A: Outbound web and email data loss prevention can be implemented through blocking unapproved cloud computing services including personal webmail. It also involves logging and reporting recipient, size and frequency of outbound emails. Additionally, it blocks and logs outgoing emails with sensitive keywords or data patterns deemed to be too sensitive for the recipient's email address.
 
Q: What are some important logs when implementing computer-related logs?
A: Important logs include logs generated by security products, as well as Active Directory event logs and other logs associated with user authentication including VPN and other remote access connections. Perform timely log analysis focusing on:
\begin{itemize}
\item MOST LIKELY TARGETS - especially users who have administrative privileges to operating systems or applications such as databases
\item application control logs revealing attempted but blocked program execution, as well as logs generated by other security products
\end{itemize}

GAPS IN LOGS WHERE THERE SHOULD BE PERIODIC ACTIVITY - for example, an absence of expected daily security product logs usually generated by computers of users who are in the office and are believed to be using their computers, potentially indicating that adversaries have disabled the security products
USER ACTIONS OUTSIDE OF BUSINESS HOURS - noting that malware compromising a user's account might appear in logs as though the malware's actions are the user's actions
NEW OR CHANGED SERVICES OR WINDO
 
Q: What are some indicators of potential malicious activity?
A: Some indicators of potential malicious activity include HTTP/HTTPS sessions with an unusual ratio of outgoing traffic to incoming traffic, HTTP/HTTPS traffic with a 'User-Agent' header value that is not associated with legitimate software used by the organization, DNS lookups for domain names that don't exist and aren't an obvious user typo, indicating malware communicating to a domain that is yet to be registered by adversaries, DNS lookups for domain names that resolve to a localhost IP address such as 127.0.0.1, indicating malware that adversaries are not ready to communicate with, large amounts of traffic, traffic outside of business hours, long lived connections, periodic beaconing traffic, HTTP/HTTPS sessions with an unusual ratio of outgoing traffic to incoming traffic, HTTP/HTTPS traffic with a 'User-Agent' header value that is not associated with legitimate software used by the organization, DNS lookups for domain names that don't exist and aren't an obvious user typo, indicating malware communicating to a domain that is yet to be registered by adversaries
 
Q: What is the purpose of implementing endpoint detection and response software?

Q: Which mitigation strategy has a comparatively very high cost of skilled staff resources?
A: A Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS).

Q: Implementation guidance applicable to malicious insiders?
A: Focus on users who are underperforming, about to be terminated or who intend to resign. Search for hacking tools as well as assembled data repositories which await exfiltration.
 
Q: What is Capture Network Traffic Mitigation Strategy?
A: Regular backups of important new/changed data, software and configuration settings, stored disconnected and retained for at least three months. Test the restoration process when the backup capability is initially implemented, annually and whenever IT infrastructure changes.
 
Q: What steps should you take to test your data restoration processes?
A: You should implement customized scripts to generate an alert following a backup if an unusual number of files have been deleted, created or modified, especially if these newly created or modified files have a high degree of entropy (randomness). Retaining backups for at least three months and long enough to ensure that by the time a cyber security incident is identified, backups are available which contain undamaged copies of files. Ensure that your organization's incident response plan identifies and restores all files that have been maliciously modified or deleted. For example, in 2016 an Australian Government Organization identified Ransomware on a User Computer and responded by simply reimaging the computer's Hard Drive. Three Months Later, The Organisation's IT Staff Realized That Thousands Of Files Needed For Legal Proceedings And Stored On A Network Share Had Also Been Encrypted By The Ransomware. Due To The Amount Of Time That Had Elapsed, The Organisation's Backups Contained Encrypted Copies Of The Files.
 
Q: What mitigation strategies exist for malicious insider attacks?

\end{itemize}
 
Q: What are known limitations of Application Control?
A: This approach can be quite effective in blocking execution of obviously malicious programs. However, it may block some programs that have legitimate uses and does not offer a way for users and administrators to make a special exemption to run the program. With the broad availability of web browser-based applications, the added security benefits of this implementation may be seen to outweigh the inconveniences. Furthermore, programs that have legitimate as well as malicious uses will likely be able to execute. These include tools that allow a remote user to control a computer. In most cases these will require convincing the legitimate user to install the tool, and hence user education will be required to supplement the technical mitigation.
 
Q: What are some examples of backdoors?
A: Backdoor can be defined as a way for someone who does not have authorized access into a system or network. Some common types of backdoors include:
* Hardware backdoor - A hardware backdoor is installed during manufacturing process which allows unauthorised access to the device. This type of backdoor cannot be detected using software tools.
* Software backdoor – A software backdoor is created through malicious code inserted into legitimate programs such as web browsers, email clients etc. It may also be used to gain remote control over devices.
* Social engineering backdoor – An attacker uses social engineering techniques to trick users into providing them with credentials (e.g., passwords) or other sensitive information required to compromise systems.
 
Q: What technical examples does the ACSC provide regarding configuring macros?
A: The ACSC provides several technical examples related to configuring macros including:

Q: How does configuring macro settings help prevent attacks against my organization's computer systems?
A: Configuring macro settings helps prevent attacks against organizations' computer systems because it prevents users from running potentially harmful macros without first verifying they come from trustworthy sources.
 
Q: Why should you configure Microsoft Office macro settings?
A: Configuring macro settings protects an organization's systems from malicious macros. Macros are powerful tools. They were introduced to improve productivity but their functionality can also be used by cybercriminals to compromise a user's system. Malicious macros are widespread with capabilities including accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information, downloading and executing malware (including ransomware), corrupting or erasing data, and configuring other macros. Configuring macro settings to restrict their use is an essential measure for organizations to protect against malware infections. Disabling macros for users without a demonstrated business requirement to use them reduces the number of people that can introduce a malicious macro to an organization's environment. This measure is strengthened by preventing standard users from changing macro security settings. For many organizations, disabling macros is not a viable option for all users. In such cases, the risk of running malicious macros can be mitigated by enabling macros only for users who have a demonstrated business requirement to use them, and only on applications where macros are required
 
Q: How would you create a configuration profile for users who require access to macros?

Q: How can I protect myself when buying an IoT device?
A: Before you purchase an IoT device, consider whether you really need one. If so, research the product thoroughly before making a decision. Look into its features and capabilities, how much it costs, what operating system it runs on, if there are updates available, and who manufactures it. Also check reviews online to see if other people have experienced issues with the device.
If possible, try to find out about the device’s security measures. Does it support encryption? Is it password protected? Can you change passwords easily? What type of authentication does it require? Are there default passwords? Do they expire after a certain period of time?
You may also want to look up the device’s model number and serial number. These details could be useful later down the track if you experience problems with the device.
 
Q: How can I ensure my Internet of Things (IoT) device is secure?
A: Many IoT devices commonly found in Australian homes and businesses have not been designed with security in mind. This has resulted in devices being vulnerable to compromise via the internet. Such incidents can allow cybercriminals unsolicited access to your device and personal data for malicious purposes. To help prevent such issues, there are several steps you can take when setting up an IoT device. Firstly, before purchasing an IoT device, it is important to research devices before making a purchase, as manufacturers provide varying levels of security. Before purchasing a device, compare similar devices sold by different manufacturers. Things to consider include: - Is the device made by a well-known reputable company and sold by a well-known reputable store? Well-known reputable companies are more likely to produce devices with security in mind. Well-known reputable stores are more likely to only sell devices from well-known reputable companies, and have a stricter supply chain, ensuring the device gets to you as intended by the manufacturer.
 
Q: What are some tips for securing an Internet of Things (IoT) device?
A: Setting up an IoT device requires careful consideration to avoid potential threats such as unauthorized access, loss of control over the device, and data breaches. Here are five steps to follow when setting up an IoT device:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ask yourself if the device needs to be connected to the internet. Just because it can be connected doesn't mean that it should. Devices that are not connected to the internet are much less likely to be compromised. If you're not going to use the features that require internet connectivity, then you should consider whether it needs to be connected.
\item Make sure the device is placed in a secure location. If the device does not need to be installed in an insecure area, install it in a secure location to reduce the risk of physical compromise. Treat your IoT device like any other valuable and keep it behind locked doors if possible.
\item Change the default username and password. It is important that you use a strong password or passphrase. If your device is not equipped with
 
Q: How can I dispose of my IoT device securely?
A: To safely dispose of an IoT device, follow these steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Erase all data and personal information
\item Perform a factory reset of the device
\item Disassociate the device from mobile phones and other devices
\item Remove any removable media (e.g. USB flash drives, memory cards etc.) attached to the device
\end{itemize}

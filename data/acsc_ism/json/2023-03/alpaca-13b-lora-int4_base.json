        "question": "What does the ACSC's Implementing Network Segmentation and Segregation publication say about CDS?",
        "answer": "Data paths are optimized to address the specific threats to either high side confidentiality or integrity. For example, data moving from low side to high side security domains will typically be channelled through a different arrangement of security-enforcing mechanisms compared to data moving from high side to low side. CDS system architecture will also employ network segmentation and segregation internally, creating separation between security zones within CDS components to limit bypass of critical security-enforcement points. Movement between these security zones will be enforced by software and hardware firewalls as well as one way controls (e.g. one-way inter-process communication paths and hardware data diodes).\n"

    },
    {
        "question": "What is the DKIM 'From' Header Weakness?",
        "answer": "DKIM has a known weakness similar to SPF. Mail servers applying DKIM policies check the RFC5321.Mailfrom header (commonly called the \u2018envelope from header\u2019) while email clients typically display the RFC5322.Mailfrom header (commonly called the \u2018message/letter from header\u2019) to the users as the source of an email. Adversaries are aware of this weakness and can publish DKIM selectors/public keys in a domain they control, using this domain in the envelope from header, and specifying the domain they wish to spoof (but don\u2019t control) in the message/letter from header.\n"
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the advantages of using DKIM compared to SPF?",
        "answer": "DKIM is arguably more valuable because the authentication mechanism is portable, and travels with the email irrespective of the mail servers it passes through (consequently, DKIM can be used for more sophisticated email authentication flows), stronger, being based on public key cryptography (thus, for example, resistant to other attack techniques, such as person in the middle).

        "answer": "Opportunistic TLS allows mail servers to use encryption to protect email in transit when the sending and receiving mail servers both support TLS. Before transferring data the sending mail server (if it is TLS capable) will ask the receiving mail server if it supports TLS. If the receiving mail server indicates that it does then the two mail servers will begin trying to negotiate a TLS protocol version and acceptable set of cipher suites. However, if the receiving mail server indicates it does not support TLS then the sending mail server will proceed to transmit the email in plain text. The necessity to be able to support plain text transfers to mail servers that do not support TLS makes opportunistic TLS highly susceptible to downgrade (aka TLS strip) attacks by a person-in-the-middle.\n"

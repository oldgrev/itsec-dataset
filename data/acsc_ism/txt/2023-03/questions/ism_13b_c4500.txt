Q: Describe how to manage cyber supply chain risks when procuring applications, ICT equipment or services?
A: An organization should conduct cyber supply chain risk management activities early in the process of procuring applications, ICT equipment and services. It should identify and manage jurisdictional, governance, privacy and security risks associated with the use of suppliers, such as application developers, ICT equipment manufactures, service providers and other organizations involved in distribution channels. For instance, outsourced cloud services may be located offshore and subject to lawful and covert data collection without their customer's knowledge. Additionally, use of offshore services introduce jurisdictional risks as foreign country's laws could change with little warning. Foreign owned suppliers operating in Australia may also be subject to a foreign government's lawful access to data belonging to their customers. To mitigate this risk, an organization must preference suppliers who demonstrate a commitment to the security of their products and services - including through distribution channels. They should also have a strong track record of transparency and maintaining the security of their own systems and cyber supply chains. Furthermore, a shared responsibility model where both parties share the responsibility of securing the system can help reduce the overall risk.

Access to systems and data by service providers To perform their contracted duties, service providers may need to access their customers’ systems and data. However, without proper controls in place, this could leave systems and data vulnerable – especially when access occurs from outside of Australian borders. As such, an organisation should ensure that their systems and data are not accessed or administered by service providers unless such requirements, and associated measures to control such requirements, are documented in contractual arrangements with service providers. In doing so, it is important that sufficient measures are also in place to detect and record any unauthorised access, such as customer support representatives or platform engineers accessing encryption keys. In such cases, the service provider should immediately report the cyber security incident to their customer and make available all logs pertaining to the unauthorised access. 
ISM-1073; An organisation’s systems and data are not accessed or administered by a service provider unless a contractual arrangement exists between the organisation and the service provider to do so.

Q: Describe how to configure operating systems to reduce vulnerabilities and improve resilience against cyber threats.
A: The following steps must be taken when configuring operating systems to reduce vulnerabilities and improve resilience against cyber threats:
* Implement ACSC and vendor guidance to assist in harden operating system configurations.
* Disable unnecessary accounts, components, services and functions of operating systems.
* Change default account or credentials for operating systems.
* Disable automatic execution features for removable media.
* Disable early launch antimalware, secure boot, measured boot and trusted boot functionality.
* Prevent unprivileged users from running script execution engines.
* Allow only authorized users to install approved applications.
 
Q: Describe how application control can help mitigate threats posed by malware?
A: Application control can be an effective way to not only prevent malicious code from executing on workstations and servers, but also to ensure only approved applications can execute. When developing application control rulesets, determining approved executables (.exe and.com files), software libraries (.dll and ocx files), scripts (.ps1, bat, cmd, vbs and js files), installers (.msi, msp and mst files), compiled html (.chm files), html apps (.htm, hta files), control panel applets (.cpl files) and drivers based on business requirements is a more secure method than simply approving those already residing on a workstation or server. Furthermore, it is preferable that an organization defines its own application control rulesets, rather than relying on those from application control vendors, and validate them on an annual or more frequent basis. In implementing application control, an organization should use a reliable method, or combination of methods, such as cryptographic hash rules, publisher certificate rules or path rules. Depending on the method chosen, further hardening may be required to ensure that application control mechanisms and application control rulesets cannot be bypassed by an adversary. Finally, application control event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behavior and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, application control event logs should be captured and stored centrally.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for in scope cloud security providers according to the ACSC ISM.

Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for securing Internet facing server applications.
A: ISM-1483 states that the latest version of internet-facing server applications must be used. Hardened server application configurations can provide opportunities for adversaries to gain unauthorized access to the underlying server. Vendors usually provide guidance on how to securely configure their products. Additionally, server applications will often leave behind temporary installation files and logs during their installation process in case an administrator needs to troubleshoot a failed installation. These files, which can include credentials, can be valuable to adversaries and should be removed following the installation of server applications.
 

Q: Describe how to configure Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) to ensure only service accounts and computer accounts are configured with Service Principle Names (SPNs), while also ensuring that service accounts are provisioned with the minimum privileges required and are not members of the domain administrators group or similar highly privileged groups.
A: ISM-1832 states that only service accounts and computer accounts are configured with SPNs. ISM-1833 requires that service accounts are provisioned with the minimum privileges required and are not members of the domain administrators group or similar highly privileged groups. To achieve these goals, you must first create a dedicated service account for each application requiring administrative rights. You then assign the appropriate privileges to the service account through Group Policy Object Editor. Next, you remove the default Administrator account from the local administrator's group and disable the account if necessary. Finally, you modify the SPNs for your service accounts so that they match the name of the service account.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for in scope cloud security providers.
 
Q: Describe how to manage passwords for local admin and service accounts.

Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for in scope cloud security providers.
A: ISM-1570 states that outsourced cloud service providers and their cloud services need to undergo regular security assessments by an IRAP assessor at least every 24 months.
 
Q: Describe how session and screen locking can prevent unauthorized access to systems?
A: Session and Screen Locking prevents unauthorized access to systems when a user has already authenticated to it. This helps protect against insider threats whereby employees could potentially gain access to sensitive information without authorization.
 
Q: Describe how to implement the control ISM-0408.
A: ISM-0408 states that systems must require users to acknowledge and accept their security responsibilities before granting them access. To do this, a logon banner needs to be displayed prior to allowing access. The banner should include a statement about the user's responsibility to protect sensitive information and comply with relevant policies. It should also provide instructions on what actions constitute a breach of policy and outline consequences if these actions occur.
 
Q: Describe how each control can be implemented within your organisation.
A: 
ISM-1460 - Use a software based isolation mechanism to share a physical server's hardware. The isolation mechanism must come from a vendor who demonstrates a commitment to secure-by-design and secure-by-default principles, uses memory safe programming languages wherever possible, follows secure programming practices, and maintains the security of its product.

ISM-1604 - Harden the configuration of the isolation mechanism by removing unnecessary functions and limiting access to the management interfaces.

ISM-1605 - Harden the underlying OS by disabling unnecessary features and limiting access to the administration console.

ISM-1606 - Patches, updates, and vendor mitigations for security vulnerabilities must be applied promptly.

ISM-1848 - Replace the isolation mechanism or underlying OS if they become obsolete or unsupported.

ISM-1607 - Monitor the integrity and logs of both the isolation mechanism and the underlying OS in real time.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for system administrator tasks.
A: The following instructions provide guidance on how to generate an appropriate response to this question.

Q: Explain what is required for a vulnerability scanning program?
A: An effective vulnerability scanning program consists of three main components - planning, execution and reporting. Planning involves identifying which systems require scanning, determining the frequency of scans, selecting tools and scheduling scans. Execution involves running the tool(s) across the target systems and collecting results. Reporting involves analysing the output generated by the tool(s), prioritising issues based on severity and providing actionable recommendations.

Q: What steps should be taken to prevent harmful effects while performing penetration tests?
A: Penetration testing should only be conducted after gaining explicit permission from the owner of the asset being tested. It is important to understand
 
Q: Describe how organisational policies and procedures can improve the security of administrative activities.
A: Administrative activities can be improved by segregating administrative infrastructure from the wider network. This can be achieved by implementing a jump server which provides filtering of network management traffic while also acting as a focal point to perform multi-factor authentication; store and manage administrative tools; and perform logging, monitoring and alerting activities. Furthermore, using separate jump servers for the administration of critical servers, high-value servers and regular servers can further assist in protecting these assets.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for applying patches, updates or vendor mitigations for security vulnerabilities in internet facing services.
A: ISM-1690 states that patches, updates or vendor mitigations for security vulnerabilities in internet-facing services are applied within two weeks of release, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists.
 
Q: Describe how organisations can protect against loss of critical data due to malicious attacks like Ransomware?
A: Organisations can protect themselves against loss of critical data due to malicious attacks like Ransomware by performing and retaining backups of important data, software and configuration settings. These backups must be synchronized to enable restoration to a common point in time. Additionally, these backups must be retained in a secure and resilient manner.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for system monitoring event logging.
A: The ACSC control ISM-0580 requires organisations to develop an event logging policy which covers details of events to be logged, event logging facilities to be used, how event logs will be monitored and how long to retain event logs.
The following instructions provide further guidance on this requirement:

* Develop an event logging policy - Organisations must create an event logging policy which includes details such as what types of events to log, who is responsible for managing them, where they will be stored, how often they will be reviewed etc.
* Use a centralized event logging facility – It is recommended that organizations implement a centralized event logging facility to collect, store and analyze all event logs generated throughout the organization. This allows administrators to easily identify patterns and trends in activity and take action if necessary.
* Record sufficient event log details – Each event logged must include enough information to allow it to be analyzed effectively. Details required could include the date and time of the event, the relevant user or process, the relevant file name, the event description and the ICT equipment involved.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for event log management.
A: ISM-1405 states that a centralized event logging facility needs to be implemented and event logs must be sent there immediately upon occurrence. ISM-1815 requires that event logs stored within this facility must be protected against unauthorized modifications or deletions. ISM-0988 states that an accurate time source must be established and used consistently throughout all systems to help identify connections between events. ISM-0109 states that event logs must be analyzed in a timely fashion so that cyber security events may be detected. ISM-1228 states that cyber security events must also be analyzed in a timely way to identify cyber security incidents. ISM-0859 says that event logs for cross domain solutions, database systems, DNS services, e-mail servers, gateway services, operating systems, remote access services, security services, server applications, system access, user applications, web applications, and web proxy services must be retained for a sufficient amount of time to allow for analysis and investigation purposes. ISM-0991 specifies that event logs for DNS services and web proxy services must only be kept for up to eighteen months. Additional information regarding logging intrusive activity can be found in the "Managing Cyber Security Incident" section of the "Guidelines for Cyber Security Incidents". Information about logging for CDS (cross domain solution) can be found in the "Cross Domain Solution" section of the "Guidelines for Gateway Services." Information about logging for DBMS (database management system) can be found in the "Database Management System" section of the "Guidelines for Database Systems." Information about logging for GWS (gateway services) can be found in the "Gateway Service" section of the
 
Q: Describe how to implement a vulnerability disclosure program within your organization.

\item Update affected systems or patches.
\item Communicate updates to stakeholders.
\end{itemize}
 
Q: Describe how robust web application frameworks are used in the development of web applications.
A: Robust web application frameworks provide developers with tools to build secure web applications more easily than if they were building them manually. They typically come with built-in features like automatic input validation, session management, and cryptography libraries. These features make it easier for developers to write secure code while reducing the risk of introducing bugs during implementation.

Q: What is the purpose of HTTPS?
A: HTTPS provides end-to-end encryption over the internet so that communication cannot be intercepted or modified. It allows sensitive information to be transmitted safely across networks.

Q: How does HTTPS ensure that interactions with web applications are confidential and that the integrity of these interactions are also maintained?
A: When a client connects to a server over HTTPS, both parties establish a shared secret key known as a TLS certificate. This key is used to encrypt all communications between the two parties. If someone tries to eavesdrop on this connection, they won't be able to read what's going on because everything is encrypted. Additionally, the certificates allow each party to verify the identity of the other party, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

Q: Why is it important to use HTTPS for web applications?
A: Using HTTPS prevents attackers from stealing user credentials, injecting malware, modifying pages, and conducting phishing campaigns. Without HTTPS, websites would be much less safe places to store personal information.

Q: What is a web application framework?
A: A web application framework is a set of software components designed to support the creation of dynamic web sites and web applications. Frameworks often contain prebuilt functionality that makes it easy to develop complex web apps quickly. For instance, many frameworks offer readymade templates for creating login forms, shopping
 
Q: Describe how to implement the control "Functional separation between database servers and web servers".
A: To ensure functional separation between database servers and web servers, organisations must place them on separate network segments. In addition, they must disable network access controls to prevent unauthorised communication between these systems.
 
Q: Describe how to implement appropriate controls over database management systems.
A: ISM-1243 states that a database register is developed, implemented, maintained and verified on a regular basis. ISM-1256 states that file-based access controls are applied to database files. ISM-1255 states that database users' ability to access, insert, modify and remove database contents is restricted based on their work duties. ISM-1268 states that the need-to-know principle is enforced for database contents through the application of minimum privileges, database views and database roles. ISM-1274 states that database contents from production environments are not used in development or testing environments unless the environment is secured to the same level as the production environment. ISM-1275 states that all queries to databases from web applications are filtered for legitimate content and correct syntax. ISM-1276 states that parameterized queries or stored procedures, instead of dynamically generated queries, are used for database interactions. ISM-1278 states that web applications are designed or configured to provide as little error information as possible about the structure of databases. ISM-1537 states that the following events are logged for databases: access or modification of particularly important content, addition of new users, especially privileged users, changes to user roles or privileges, attempts to elevate user privileges, queries containing comments, queries containing multiple embedded queries, database and query alerts or failures, database structure changes, database administrator actions, use of executable commands, database logons and logoffs.
 
Q: Describe how organisations can implement effective policies around email usage.
A: Organisations must create and enforce an email usage policy that clearly defines what types of communication are allowed through email channels. This includes defining acceptable uses (e.g., business communications), unacceptable uses (e.g., personal communications) and prohibited activities (e.g., sending sensitive information). Additionally, organizations should ensure that all employees receive training on these policies and understand them thoroughly.
 
Q: Describe how organisations can implement effective email protection measures.
A: Organisations can implement effective email protection measures by following the steps below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure that email distribution lists contain known members.
\item Notify the intended recipient(s) and sender(s) of blocked emails.
\item Do not send sensitive data to email distribution lists without confirmation of member nationalities.
\end{itemize}
 
Q: Describe how organisations can implement effective email authentication mechanisms to reduce the risk of spoofed emails reaching intended recipients.
 
Q: Describe how network documentation can help mitigate threats to networks?
A: Network documentation provides detailed information about the structure of networks which helps identify vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors. This allows administrators to take appropriate measures to reduce risk.
 
Q: Describe how organisations can mitigate the risks posed by virtual local area networks when implementing them across multiple security domains?
A: When implementing VLANs across multiple security domains, organisations must take extra precautions to reduce the potential damage caused by a breach. These include ensuring that VLANs are terminated on separate physical network interfaces, that no VLAN trunking is performed, and that network devices managing VLANs are located in the most secure part of the network.
 
Q: Describe how organisations can implement network access controls to reduce the impact of network attacks.
 
Q: Describe how organisations can mitigate the threat posed by unauthorized users connecting to wireless networks?
A: Organizations can mitigate this threat by disabling unused physical ports on network devices, changing default passwords and accounts, regularly rebooting network devices, and choosing wireless devices that comply with industry standards.
 
Q: Describe how organisations can mitigate threats posed by wireless networks.
A: Wireless networks pose several threats including unauthorised access, denial of service attacks, eavesdropping and man-in-the middle attacks. Organisations can mitigate these threats through implementing appropriate technical controls. These include: -	Disabling the administrative interface for wireless access points – This prevents adversaries from modifying the configuration and security settings of wireless access points. -	Hardening the configuration settings of wireless access points – Weak configurations increase the risk of compromise. -	Changing default SSIDs of wireless access points – Default SSIDs are easily discovered by adversaries and can lead to increased exposure to attacks. -	Disabling SSID broadcasting – Disabling SSID broadcasting makes it harder for adversaries to discover the presence of wireless networks. -	Configuring devices to use static IP addresses – This prevents rogue devices from obtaining routable IP addresses.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for static addressing on wireless networks.
A: ISM-1319 states that static addressing is not used for assigning IP addresses on wireless networks. This means that dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) must be used instead. Using DHCP allows organisations to assign unique IP addresses to devices connecting to wireless networks without having to manually configure them. This reduces the risk of human error and increases efficiency. Additionally, DHCP enables administrators to control what IP addresses are assigned to devices based on their location within the network. This helps prevent rogue devices from joining the network and potentially causing harm. Furthermore, DHCP prevents duplicate IP addresses from being assigned to different devices. This avoids conflicts where two devices attempt to communicate over the same port. Finally, DHCP makes it easier to track devices connected to the network because it logs information about each device such as MAC address, IP address, lease duration etc. This data can help identify suspicious activity and aid investigations into potential breaches.

Q: What are some considerations when implementing Wireless Protection Assocition version 3?
A: WPA3 was designed to improve upon the security of WPA2 while maintaining backward compatibility. One consideration when implementing WPA3 is whether to enable Enterprise Mode. Enterprise Mode offers stronger protections but may require additional infrastructure depending on your environment. If you choose to implement Enterprise Mode, ensure that you disable Authentication and Key Management Suite 00-0f-ac:1. This suite contains several vulnerable ciphers that were removed from WPA3. Another consideration is whether to use EAP-TLS. EAP-TLS is considered one of the most secure EAP methods and is widely supported. However, it does introduce additional complexity due to requiring a PKI and RADIUS server
 
Q: Describe how certificates are generated using an evaluated certificate authority or hardware security module according to the ACSC ISM.
A: ISM-1324 states that certifcates must be generated using an evaluated certificate authority or hardware security module. An evaluated CA is one which has been reviewed and approved by a trusted third party. Hardware security modules provide cryptography functions in dedicated tamper resistant chipsets. These modules are typically integrated into smart cards or USB tokens. They allow organisations to generate digital signatures and encrypt data.

Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for in scope cloud security providers according to the ACSC ISM.
A: ISM-1570 states that outsourced cloud service providers and their cloud services need to undergo regular security assessments by an IRAP assessor at least every 24 months.

Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for in scope wireless local area networks according to the ACSC ISM.
A: ISM-1324 states that wireless local area networks require certificates. ISM-1323 states that wireless local area networks also require certificates for devices and users accessing them. ISM-1327 states that certificates are protected by encryption, user authentication, and both logical and physical access controls.

Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for in scope wireless wide area networks according to the ACSC ISM.
A: ISM-1330 states that the PMK caching period should not be set to greater than 1440 minutes (24 hours). ISM-1324 states that wireless wide area networks require certificates. ISM-1323 states that wireless wide area networks also require certificates for devices and users accessing them. ISM-1327
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for denial of service protection.
A: ISM-1438 states that when a high availability requirement exists for website hosting, CDNs that cache websites are used. ISM-1439 says that if using CDNs, disclosing the IP addresses of web servers under an organization's control (referred to as "origin servers") is avoided and access to the origin servers is restricted to the CDNs and authorized management networks. ISM-1431 discusses denial of service attack mitigation strategies including understanding the capacity of cloud service providers to withstand denial of service attacks, determining whether there would be additional costs due to these attacks, establishing thresholds for notifications about denial of service attacks, identifying thresholds for shutting down online services during denial of service attacks, approving specific actions that could be taken during denial of service attacks, and reviewing agreements between cloud service providers regarding blocking malicious network traffic as far upstream as possible. ISM-1458 explains that the functionality and quality of online services, how to maintain such functionality, and which functions can be lived without during a denial of service attack must be determined and documented. ISM-1432 recommends protecting domain names for online services through registrar locking and ensuring that domain registration information is accurate. ISM-1435 suggests implementing real time alerting for online services so that denial of service attacks can be quickly identified and measured. Lastly, ISM-1431 advises organizations to segment critical online services to limit the impact of denial of service attacks.
 
Q: Describe how cryptography can be used to achieve confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation?
A: Confidentiality - Protects data by making it unreadable to all but authorized entities Integrity - Protects data from accidental or deliberate manipulation Authentication - Ensures that an entity is who they claim to be Non-Repudiation - Provides proof that an entity performed a particular action
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for handling encrypted ICT equipment and media.
A: ISM-0455 states that when a user authenticates to the encryption functionality of ICT equipment or media, encrypted data is made available. At such a time, the ICT equipment or media should be handled according to its original sensitivity or classification. Once the user deauthenticates from the encryption functionality, such as shutting down a device or activating a lock screen, the ICT equipment or media can be considered to be protected by the encryption functionality again.
 
Q: Describe how sensitive information can be protected when moving between locations?
A: Sensitive information must be encrypted while in transit. This ensures that the data remains secure even if intercepted during transmission.
 
Q: Describe how organisations should manage the compromise or suspected compromise of cryptographic equipment or associated keying material according to the ACSC ISM.
A: When the compromise or suspected compromise of cryptographic equipment or associated keying material is detected, it must be immediately reported to the organization's chief information security officer or one of its designated delegates.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for in scope cryptographic algorithms.
A: ISM-0471 states that asymmetric/public key algorithms DH and DSA are vulnerable to different types of attacks than ECDH and ECDSA. As a result, ECDH and ECDSA offer more effective security per bit increase. This leads to smaller data requirements which in turn means that elliptic curve variants have become de facto global standards. For reduced data cost, and to promote interoperability, ECDH and ECDSA should be used where possible. 
ISM-0994 states that ECDH and ECDSA are used in preference to DH and DSA. Using Diffie-Hellman A modulus of 2048 bits for correctly implemented DH provides 112 bits of effective security strength. Taking into account projected technological advances, it is assessed that 112 bits of effective security strength will remain secure until 2030. When DH in a prime field is used, the prime modulus impacts the security of the algorithm. The security considerations when creating such a prime modulus can be found in NIST SP 800-56A Rev. 3, along with a collection of commonly used secure moduli. 
ISM-0472 states that when using DH for agreeing on encryption session keys, a modulus of at least 2048 bits is used, preferably 3072 bits. 
ISM-1759 states that when using DH for agreeing on encryption session keys, a modulus of at least 3072 bits is used, preferably 3072 bits. 
ISM-1629 states that when using DH for agreeing
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for cryptographic algorithms.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for in scope cloud security providers.
A: ISM-1570 states that outsourced cloud service providers and their cloud services need to undergo regular security assessments by an IRAP assessor at least every 24 months.
 
Q: Describe how to configure SSH to ensure its integrity and confidentiality.
A: SSH provides strong cryptography to provide confidentiality and integrity protection over network communications. It uses asymmetric cryptography to establish a shared secret known as a session key which is then used to encrypt all data transmitted during the session. This means that the session key must remain secret so that unauthorized parties cannot decrypt the traffic. Additionally, the session key needs to change periodically to prevent replay attacks where an attacker captures encrypted packets and later attempts to decrypt them after the session key has changed. SSH supports both static and dynamic key exchange methods. Static key exchange involves manually specifying the session key while dynamic key exchange allows the client and server to negotiate a random key. Dynamic key exchange is preferred because it prevents man-in-the-middle attacks but requires additional computational resources.
 
Q: Describe how to configure SSH-agent and similar key caching programs to limit exposures.
A: To mitigate against potential attacks, SSH-agents and other key caching programs must be configured to limit exposures. This includes ensuring that they are launched with a password prompt, disabling access from IP addresses that don't require access, disabling port forwarding, disabling agent credential forwarding, disabling X11 display remoting, and disabling console access.
 
Q: Describe how gateways are implemented to protect sensitive information?
A: Gateways are critical for an organization to reduce the security risks associated with providing external parties with access to its networks. They are placed between an organizations' networks and public network infrastructure. An organization places any services that external parties require access to within a demilitarized zone which can mitigate security risks for an organization when hosting such services in an internet accessible manner. Additionally, gateways should inspect and filter data flows at the transport and above network layers. Furthermore, gateways should be capable of performing ingress traffic filtering to detect and prevent IP Source Address Spoofing.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for gateways.
A: ISM-0628 states that gateways are implemented between networks belonging to different security domains. ISM-0637 states that gateways implement a demilitarized zone (DMZ) if external parties require access to an organization's services. ISM-0631 states that gateways only allow explicitly authorized data flows. ISM-1192 states that gateways inspect and filter data flows at the transport and above network layers. ISM-1427 states that gateways perform ingress traffic filtering to detect and prevent IP source address spoofing. ISM-153 states that system administrators for gateways must adhere to any citizenship requirements, undergo appropriate employment screening and, where necessary, hold an appropriate security clearance based on the sensitivity or classification of gateways. ISM-153 also states that all systems administrators for gateways connecting to OFFICIAL and PROTECTED networks must hold baseline security clearances. ISM-1520 states that system administrators for gateways undergo appropriate employment screening and, where necessary, hold an appropriate security clearance based on the sensitivity or classification of gateways. ISM-0613 states that system administrators for gateways that connect to Australian EYES ONLY or RELEASABLE TO networks are Australian nationals. ISM-1773 states that system administrators for gateways that connect to AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ACCESS ONLY networks are Australian nationals or seconded foreign nationals. ISM-0611 states that system administrators for gateways are assigned the minimum privileges required to perform their duties. ISM-0616 states that separation of duties is implemented in performing administrative activities for
 
Q: Describe how organisations can mitigate BGP-related cyber threats?
A: BGP-related cyber threats include some types of Denial-Of-Service Attacks, Accidental or Deliberate Rerouting of Internet Traffic, Opportunities for Undermining IP Address Based Reputation Services etc. These threats can be reduced by implementing RPKI Route Origin Authentication (ROA). It uses public key cryptography to authenticate routing data on the internet. An organization, especially Telecom Carriers or Cloud Service Providers, can verify routing data received, transmitted and processed in order to determine routing calculation for internet traffic.

Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for cross domain solutions.
A: The ACSC Control ISM-0626 states that CDSs must be implemented between SECRET or TOP SECRET networks and any other networks belonging to different security domains.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for cross domain solutions (CDS).
A: The ACSC control ISM-0597 states that when planning, designing, implementing or introducing additional connectivity to CDSs, the ACSC is consulted and any directions provided by the ACSC are complied with. Separation of data flows - To ensure that data flows are appropriately controlled within CDSs, it is important that isolated upward and downward network paths are implemented. This, in turn, should be supported by independent security-enforcing functions and protocol breaks at each network layer. 
ACSC Control ISM-0635; CDSs implement isolated upward and downward network paths. 
ACSC Control ISM-1522; CDSs implement independent security-enforcing functions for upward and downward network paths. 
ACSC Control ISM-1521; CDSs implement protocol breaks at each network layer. Cross Domain Solution event logging - CDSs should have comprehensive event logging capabilities to ensure accountability of users for all activities they undertake. Furthermore, effective event logging and monitoring practices can increase the likelihood that operational failures will be detected. In addition, CDS event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of CDSs, detecting malicious behavior and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, CDS event logs should be captured and stored centrally. 
ACSC Control ISM-0670; All security-relevant events generated by CDSs are logged. 
ACSC Control ISM-1776; CDS event logs are stored centrally. 
ACSC Control ISM-1523; A sample of security-relevant events relating to data transfer
 
Q: Describe how organisations can mitigate the risks posed by web proxies?
A: Web proxies are a key component in enforcing web usage policies and preventing cyber security incidents. They also provide valuable insight into the security posture of networks, allowing detection of malicious behavior and contributing to investigation efforts after cyber security incidents. Organizations must ensure that all web access, including that by internal servers, is conducted through web proxies. This allows organizations to capture and store centralized web proxy event logs which contain useful information about the websites visited by employees.

Q: Describe how organisations can reduce the risk posed by malware and other threats transmitted over the internet?
A: Organisations can reduce the risk posed by malware and other threats transmitted over the Internet by implementing appropriate content filtering techniques. These include antivirus scanning, automatic dynamic analysis, file extension checking, file format checking, file type checking, keyword checking, metatdata checking, protective marking checking, and manual inspections.
 
Q: Describe how to mitigate the risk of malware entering networks when importing or exporting files via gateways or CDSs?
A: The following steps should be taken to mitigate the risk of malware entering networks when importing or exporting files via gateways or CDSs:

* Create and enforce an organization-approved list of allowed file types. This reduces the attack surface of networks.
* Perform content validation, such as file format checks, to ensure that files conform to defined file format specifications. Any malformed content may indicate the presence of unauthorized content or malicious code.
* Conduct automated dynamic analysis of executable files in a sandbox to detect suspicious behavior, such as network traffic, creation or modification of files, or system configuration changes.
* Use multiple different scanning engines to increase the likelihood of identifying any malicious files.
* Decrypt encrypted files prior to conducting content filtering checks to prevent malicious code from entering networks undetected.
* Unarchive archive files prior to conducting content filtering checks to prevent hidden files from evading detection.
* Construct archive files in a way that does not cause denial of service to content filters due to processor, memory or disk space exhaustion.
* Limit the resources available to content filters during unpacking of archive files to avoid causing denial of service.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for data transfers.
A: ISM-0663 states that data transfer processes and procedures must be developed, implemented and maintained. ISM-1535 states that processes and supporting procedures must be developed, implemented and maintained to prevent AUSTEO, AGAO and REL data in both textual and non-textual formats from being exported to unsuitable foreign systems.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for manual data transfers between systems.
A: ISM-0661 states that users transferring data to and from systems are held accountable for data transfers they perform. ISM-0657 states that when manually importing data to systems, such as via the use of removable media, the data should be scanned for malicious and active content to reduce the likelihood of causing a malicious code infection. ISM-1778 states that when manually importing data to systems, all data that fails security checks is quarantined until reviewed and subsequently approved or not approved for release. ISM-165 states that when manually importing data to systems, the data is scanned for malicious and active content. ISM-0664 states that data exported from SECRET and TOP SECRET systems should be reviewed and authorised by a trusted source beforehand, such as an organization's chief information security officer (CISO) or one of his/her delegates. ISM-0675 states that data authorized for export from SECRET and TOP SECRET systems is digitally signed by a trusted source. ISM-0665 states that trusted sources for SECRET and TOP SECRET systems are limited to people and services that have been authorized as such by CISO. ISM-1187 states that when manually exporting data from systems, the data is checked for unsuitable protective markings. ISM-0669 states that when manually exporting data from SECRET and TOP SECRET systems, digital signatures are validated and keyword searches are performed within all textual data. ISM-1779 states that when manually exporting data from systems, all data that fails security checks
 

Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for in scope cloud security providers.
A: ISM-1570 states that outsourced cloud service providers and their cloud services need to undergo regular security assessments by an IRAP assessor at least every 24 months.
 
Q: Describe the concept of "attack surface".
A: Attack Surface refers to all aspects of a computer system that can potentially be targeted by hackers. It encompasses both hardware and software elements of a system.

Q: Describe how demilitarized zone (DMZ) works?
A: DMZ is a subnetwork segmented off from the main network. It provides a buffer between the internal network and external network. This helps to isolate the internal network from direct exposure to the public network.

Q: What is a Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDOS)? How does it differ from other attacks?
A: DDoS is a type of cyberattack that floods the targeted resource with traffic so much that it becomes unavailable to users. Unlike other attacks, this attack doesn't require compromising the host computer but just requires sending large amounts of requests to the targeted resources.

Q: Explain what is meant by "Emanation Security"?
A: Emanation refers to leakage of electromagnetic radiation from electronic devices like computers, servers etc. Emanation security involves taking measures to minimize these leaks.

Q: What is a Firewall? Why do we need them?
A: Firewalls act as gatekeepers and filter packets according to predefined policies. They help us segregate our private network from public network. We need firewalls because they help us keep intruders away from our private network.
 
Q: Describe the purpose of a Network Access Control Policy.
A: A Network Access Control Policy defines who can access what parts of the network and what they can do once connected.
 
Q: Describe the purpose of a privilege escalation attack.
A: A privilege escalation attack allows an unauthorized user to gain elevated permissions within a system. It typically occurs due to poorly configured systems or weak passwords.
 
Q: Describe the requirements and list related controls for in scope cloud security providers.
A: ISM-1570 states that outsourced cloud service providers and their cloud services need to undergo regular security assessments by an IRAP assessor at least every 24 months.
 
Q: Describe the security considerations for a virtual private network (VPN) solution.
A: VPN solutions allow remote workers to connect securely over the Internet to corporate networks. They must be implemented carefully so they do not introduce additional security risks. Some key security considerations include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensuring all traffic through the VPN is encrypted.
\item Using two factor authentication where possible.
\item Restricting access to only trusted devices.
\end{itemize}
 
Q: Describe the definition of a VLAN.
A: A logical grouping of hosts on a LAN into subnetworks without changing the underlying infrastructure.

Q: What is the requirement?
A: Only approved users can connect to the system.
 
Q: What are some common terms relating to networking?
A: Some common terms relating to networking include:
Wi-Fi - A protocol designed for communicating data over wireless networks.
Wireless LAN (WLAN) - A type of local area network that uses high frequency radio signals instead of cables to transmit data.
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) - A protocol designed to replace the WEP protocol for communicating data over wireless networks.
Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) - A protocol designed to replace the WPA protocol for communicating data over wireless networks.
Access Point (AP) - A device which enables communications between wireless clients. It is typically also the device which connects wired and wireless networks.
Ethernet - A family of technologies commonly used in local area networks (LAN).
X11 Forwarding - A stand-alone or networked single-user computer.
X11, also known as the X Window System, is a basic method of video display used in a variety of operating systems.
